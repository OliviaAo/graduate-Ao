Central access was gained and a chest x-ray was done which showed [**Hospital Customize 2**] pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as [**Doctor or Patient Name **] tube .
Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 34**] of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .
His chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .
The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with [**Doctor or Patient Name 20**] degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , 1992 .
At the time of this study , the [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary [**Doctor or Patient Name 23**] pressure was 10 .
A dominant [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .
A large [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .
The saphenous vein graft to the [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .

The GI Service was consulted on this [**Doctor or Patient Name **] and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .
This confirmed an 8 mm. [**Doctor or Patient Name **] which was bright on T2 and homogeneous in the [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with a benign hemangioma or cyst .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] side and ability to walk with assistance .
He still had a significant [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] central facial droop .
He had approximately 4+ to 5/5 strength in the [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] upper and lower extremities .
He had marked dysmetria bilaterally , but left greater than [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] to finger to nose and his gait was very ataxic .
He had [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] clonus , which was sustained .
At that time , there was [**Hospital Customize 2**] evidence of a [**Doctor or Patient Name **] behind the hematoma .

A cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 34**] of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 12**] q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate [**Doctor or Patient Name 12**] intake to maintain her volume status .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter felt that it was likely that her [**Doctor or Patient Name 12**] intake would improve when she returned [**Doctor or Patient Name 10**] to the nursing [**Doctor or Patient Name 10**] .
I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her [**Doctor or Patient Name 12**] intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .
