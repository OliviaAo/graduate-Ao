CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA .
The patient is a 76 year old man , who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 93**]</PHI> after an anterolateral MI , with post MI stuttering chest [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] .
His coronary risks factors are prior MI , smoking until he quit more than forty years ago , and adult onset diabetes with question of increased cholesterol .
At that time he was placed on Quinidine for his arrhythmia , questioned atrial fibrillation at that time .
He was ruled in for a non-Q wave MI with peak CKs of 531 , positive for MB .
This course was complicated by a transient left bundle branch block on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-17**]</PHI> , atrial fibrillation despite his Quinidine .
He had a new apical systolic murmur noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-18**]</PHI> .
Status post cholecystectomy , status post [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] inguinal herniorrhaphy .
The patient was [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] free and resting comfortably .
His neck showed a left-sided carotid which was 2+ without bruit , and a [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**]-sided carotid which was 1+ without bruit .
His jugulovenous distention was to 10 centimeters .
His one-year examination had bilateral basilar rales greater on the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] than the left .
Rectal :
Guaiac positive .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN and creatinine of 29/1.4 , glucose 142 , hematocrit was 30.9 .
Pre-intubation ABG was pH of 7.39 , p02 81 , O2 saturation of 96% , C02 29 , total C02 18 .
After intubation his pH was 7.32 with a p02 208 , and 02 saturation 99.7% , pC02 28 , total C02 15 .
Magnesium 2.1 initially and during the code was 1.8 , cholesterol 144 , triglyceride 121 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] free with EKG ST depressions laterally .
Around 4:00 p.m. this occurred and he was given a beta blocker 2.5 mg IV push [**Doctor or Patient Name 3**] four .
Later , within an half hour the blood pressure dipped into the 70s systolic , and IV fluid was started .
The patient complained of [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] between his shoulder blades and at this time IV fluid was increased , so was the Dopamine and Dobutamine .
Atropine X 2 amps were given and the heart rate was in the 60s with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 to 90 range by Doppler .
Surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump .
Central access was gained and a chest x-ray was done which showed [**Hospital Customize **] pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as [**Doctor or Patient Name **] tube .
At this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .
Autopsy was requested , however , the patient &apos;s family will not give [**Hospital Customize 94**] their decision until tomorrow morning .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-25**]</PHI>/93
DISCHARGE DATE :
aortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfonamides .
cardiac catheterization - <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-01**]</PHI>/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-27**]</PHI>/93 .
Lasix 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 95**]</PHI> underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .
He also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .
Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .
Over these past 3 years , he has remained [**Doctor or Patient Name 11**] , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .
He returned for routine office evaluation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-25**]</PHI>/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .
There was dullness at both bases , with rales [**01-03**] way upon the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] , and at the base on the left .
The [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .
The left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .
There was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .
LABORATORY DATA :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .
At the time of this study , the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] atrial pressure was 1 , the [**Doctor or Patient Name **] pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .
The aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .
The posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .
The saphenous vein graft to the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .
Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .
It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 95**]</PHI> aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .
He seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .

The rectal tone was normal with [**Hospital Customize **] enlarged prostate , and he was heme positive .
Neurologically , he opened his eyes with sternal rub , but not verbalization .
He did not have verbal communication and he did not follow verbal commands .
His pupils were asymmetric , 6 mm. to 4 mm. on the left , [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] pupil was 5 mm. reacting to 3 mm.
He responded to threat on the left , but not on the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] .
The tongue was midline .
He had slight decreased corneal reflex on the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] .
Motor - [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] flaccid arm and he moved his left purposefully , but did not squeeze his hands .
His deep tendon reflexes were noted for symmetric reflexes with upper extremities being 2 and [**Doctor or Patient Name 96**] 3 .
There was [**Doctor or Patient Name 28**] effect and some midline shift .
The patient was admitted to then Neurologic Intensive Care Unit .
Once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .
Given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar [**Doctor or Patient Name 28**] .
This was followed up with a bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest I minus on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**07-27**]</PHI>/92 did not show the [**Doctor or Patient Name 28**] initially noted .
A testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for [**Doctor or Patient Name 28**] .
An abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non-enhancing .
The GI Service was consulted on this [**Doctor or Patient Name 28**] and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .
He needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .
Speech was nonfluent with occasional single words .
He followed all commands readily .
He squints with his left eye when he tries to focus and claims this is because he sees double .
His left side was full .
He had marked dysmetria bilaterally , but left greater than [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] to finger to nose and his gait was very ataxic .
His deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] with 3 [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and [**Doctor or Patient Name 96**] .
A head computerized tomography scan was repeated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**08-08**]</PHI>/92 which revealed some resolution of blood .

This extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
Further evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 49**]</PHI> , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
There was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
There was [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .
In addition , she was evaluated by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital 105**] Medical Center</PHI> and there was [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of active dental infection .
She had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
Also , [**Hospital Customize **] source for sepsis had been found .
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .
Accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**07-21**]</PHI>/93 .
During her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .
Her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .
Her valve was replaced with a St. [**Doctor 106**] Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
With clotting [**Doctor or Patient Name 107**] replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was [**Hospital Customize **] longer a problem .
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .
After consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**07-26**]</PHI>/93 at 11:10 a.m.

In addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**08-03**]</PHI>-93 .
Cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .
The left ventricular ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] was estimated to 38% .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in [**Hospital Customize **] acute distress .
The blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury .
Her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .
The cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line .
The examination the abdomen was benign .
She had good pulses bilaterally .
There were non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .
Following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty .
Therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a [**Doctor or Patient Name 110**] than 10% residual narrowing .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .

SOCIAL HISTORY :
At baseline by report the patient was self-sufficient and aided in the care of her husband .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
In general , she was well appearing in [**Hospital Customize **] apparent distress .
The chest was clear bilaterally .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with good bowel sounds .
There was only mild suprapubic fullness that was not tender .
There was [**Hospital Customize **] guarding or rebound .
There was [**Hospital Customize **] peripheral edema .
She moved all extremities .
She had decreased strength bilaterally .
She appeared to understand questions , but then could not come up with the answers , or where she was , and she could not give her name , but did respond when her name was used .
Abdominal CT scan from the outside hospital showed [**Hospital Customize **] abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts .
As noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative Clostridium difficile , a weakly positive D-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
An lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .
In addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , [**Signature **] antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .
In addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .
For her FEN , the patient was able to take [**Doctor or Patient Name 19**] &apos;s and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take [**Doctor or Patient Name 19**] &apos;s with one to one supervision .

[**Hospital Customize 4**] obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .
Excellent suggestions from Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor or Patient Name **]</PHI> of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient &apos;s weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .
CA-125 [**Doctor or Patient Name 14**] were within normal limits .

Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor or Patient Name 172**]</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Pedines Community Hospital</PHI> found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .
The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .
We could not catheterize her [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] away because her prothrombin time was a [**Doctor or Patient Name 173**] too high .
Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .
The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and [**Hospital Customize **] mitral regurgitation [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] on left ventricular angiogram .
Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of [**Hospital Customize **] clinical significance .
A permanent pacemaker was put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**05-06**]</PHI>/92 .
On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four [**Doctor or Patient Name 3**] a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .
On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .
We will ambulate her over the next couple of days .

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">En&apos;s Healthcare</PHI> for work-up .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">[**01-02**]</PHI> CT scan of the chest showed a type III descending thoracic aortic aneurysm beginning distal to the left subclavian artery and ending above the renal artery .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">[**01-04**]</PHI> , a CT scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , parenchymal consolidation [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] greater than left , aortic dissection with true and false lumens , well delineated flap with compression of the true lumen secondary to [**Doctor or Patient Name 28**] effect of thrombus in the false lumen .
There was a mediastinal hematoma .
There was a low density abnormality surrounding the ascending aorta .
The patient reports having been hospitalized for approximately one month , at which time she was discharged to a nursing [**Doctor or Patient Name 15**] after refusing surgery .
The patient has had dyspnea on exertion since <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> , 1996 , increasing in the last month , and increasing abdominal distention .
She has had atrial fibrillation for five years .
[**Hospital Customize 4**] syncope but she occasionally has dizziness .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
Hypertension .
Hiatal hernia .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfa , which gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS :
Her medications on admission were aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Lopressor 50 milligrams p.o.b.i.d. ; Glyburide 2.5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Premarin 0.625 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Lasix 40 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Trandate 200 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Prevacid 30 milligrams p.o. q.d.
She is in [**Hospital Customize **] acute distress .
Blood pressure is 138/72 .
She is on room air at 90% .
The lungs demonstrated wheezes on auscultation with crackles at the bases .
There was pedal edema to the ankles bilaterally .
Varicosities particularly left lower extremity front and back and [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] upper extremity medially .
There were 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally , 2+ radial pulses bilaterally .
Neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
The patient was admitted for preoperative work-up prior to planned repair of her ascending aortic dissection .
Given her history reported from outside source of a bleeding diathesis , Hematology consult was obtained who felt that she had [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of qualitative abnormality orcoagulopathy .
The patient received periprocedure antibiotics .
The ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] was estimated at 55% .
The ascending aorta appeared severely dilated immediately after the root at 7.7 centimeters .
There was pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 34 mmHg plus [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] atrial pressure .
There was also evidence of a secundum type atrioseptal defect , approximately 0.5 centimeters in size , with elevated [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] atrial pressure .
Evidence of atrioseptal defect again was noted with a calculation of 2:1 .
The true lumen required access by [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] radial artery and tortuous innominate artery .
Postoperatively the patient did require epinephrine and Levophed as well as resuscitation , multiple blood products .
On postoperative day [**Doctor or Patient Name **] one , however , the patient was hemodynamically [**Doctor or Patient Name 11**] on a small amount of heparin and nitroglycerin with a cardiac index of 3 .
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day [**Doctor or Patient Name **] three .
She did demonstrate evidence of a [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] brachial neuropathy , likely associated with the extensive dissection required for access to the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] axillary artery , given the patient &apos;s distorted anatomy due to the large dissection .
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and received therapy to the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] upper extremity and hand .
Her chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated bilateral small effusions , [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] greater than left .
On 2 liters nasal cannulaoxygen , she is saturating at 93-95% .
She will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Spotted</PHI> in four to six weeks ; with her cardiologist in one week .

1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 200**]</PHI> was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**01-17**]</PHI>/91 .
He was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 197**]</PHI> at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 201**]</PHI> where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
2) Recent PCP .
[**Name10 (NameIs) 202**] patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .
On presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .
SKIN :
Jaundiced .
HEENT :
NECK :
LUNGS :
There was [**Hospital Customize **] costovertebral angle tenderness .
Soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] upper quadrant tenderness .
His liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .
EXTREMITIES :
GENITOURINARY :
NEUROLOGICAL :
ALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .
His chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required [**Doctor or Patient Name 110**] oxygen .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-11**]</PHI>/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-11**]</PHI>/91 .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-12**]</PHI>/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
[**Hospital Customize 4**] other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
Fortunately , [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
DISPOSITION :
The patient died in hospital .
An autopsy will be performed .

None .
None .
WORD DISABILITY AND PROBABLY DURATION :
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] noted to be 28 percent in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1997 .
She also has a history of urinary tract infection .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] facial droop and left-sided weakness .
There was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had [**Hospital Customize **] pedal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
A KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but [**Hospital Customize **] free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 25</PHI> where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .
A head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] frontal and cerebellar lobes .
There was diffuse atrophy and [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient &apos;s diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 19**] q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
Her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] facial droop .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed [**Hospital Customize **] acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] .
Her ferritin was 83 and there was [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of guaiac positive stools .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
However , with the assistance of the patient &apos;s granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her [**Doctor or Patient Name **] intake with a lot of assistance .
I will get in touch with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Areas</PHI> and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .

Bowel sounds were present .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 107 beats per minute .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan :
Pancreatitis , fluid collection in the lesser sac .
A perisplenic effusion was noted which appeared to communicate with the lesser sac collection .
Gallbladder was visualized with stones .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .
An echocardiogram was done .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
The fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-27**]</PHI> .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
Approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .
The computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
Drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
He remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .

SUMMARY PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
DUODENAL PERFORATION
This is a 60 year-old gentleman with a past medical history of gastric lymphoma status post total gastrectomy / splenectomy in [**1991**] with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
History of small bowel obstruction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-17**]</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**07-15**]</PHI> , pancytopenia , history of [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] renal calculus .
ALLERGIES :
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 65 , blood pressure 101/74 , 100 percent oxygen saturation on room air .
There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-13**]</PHI>/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .
This was taken down and the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .
There was [**Hospital Customize **] other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
However by the mid morning of the <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-14**]</PHI> , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .
The Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .
Upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .
An incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .
Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] spermatic [**Doctor or Patient Name 33**] , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .
therefore the patient went back to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-15**]</PHI>/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .
Further debridement was undertaken .
Unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .
The patient &apos;s family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-16**]</PHI>/00 .
The patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-17**]</PHI>/00 .

The patient is a seventy-two-year-old male with a history of diffuse atherosclerotic disease who had a coronary artery bypass graft in [**1989**] followed a failed angioplasty .
He was admitted when he failed medical therapies for a diagnostic catheterization to evaluate his saphenous grafts and his native coronary circulation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The left femoral is barely perceptible , [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] femoral two plus with a bruit .
The abdominal aorta was approximately 4 cm .
LABORATORY DATA :
HOSPITAL COURSE :
With regard to his saphenous grafts , the saphenous vein graft to the LAD was patent , as were the grafts to LADD1 and to the marginal territory .
The patient had recurrent chest [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] at rest in the hospital .
Antianginals were increased and including Procardia was increased to 90 q.d.
These changes in his medical regiment seemed to significantly improve his angina .
It was decided that he would be discharged on medical management .
We were very reluctant to recommend further invasive interventions in view of his dissuse atherosclerosis and renal failure , which make him a very high risk candidate for further PTCAs .
During the hospitalization the patient was dialyzed for his renal failure .
He received dialysis without complication .
The patient was anemic .
Activities as tolerated .
He is to be followed-up by his private doctor .

[**First Name (Titles) 277**] [**Last Name (Titles) 278**] :
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Question seizure / loss of consciousness with hypoglycemia , fingerstick blood sugar of 24 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
An 82-year-old male with a history of CAD status post CABG , CVA status post CEA , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , GI bleeding , CHF with an EF of 35% , left lower lobe pneumonia on admission on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**01-22**]</PHI>/04 - <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**01-31**]</PHI>/2004 , PVD and bladder cancer .
The patient , after having his melanotic stool , had a question seizure-like activity with question loss of consciousness .
The patient was transferred to the ED .
Of [**Hospital Customize 64**] , in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Genearocktemp Ry Health</PHI> ED the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 23.7 down from low 30s , a troponin of 5.8 , and an EKG with afib showing peak T-waves .
Thus , the patient was admitted to the Medical Service for GI workup including possibly EGD .
Of [**Hospital Customize 64**] , the patient had a previously scheduled EGD for <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-17**]</PHI> .
Ischemia :
The patient is status post a non ST elevation MI , a troponin peaked at 22 likely secondary to dehydration and presentation of acute renal failure .
The patient was managed on a beta blocker .
Aspirin was held second to his concurrent GI bleed .
Lasix was given after each unit of packed red blood cells .
Overall , the patient had preserved LV function despite a large troponin leak .
Rate and rhythm :
A GI consult was obtained and the patient had adequate IV access .
Per GI consult given the patient &apos;s non ST elevation MI he would be a high risk candidate for a GI endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non ST elevation MI period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective GI workup in 4-6 weeks .
The patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of bright red blood per rectum or large amounts of melena .
On admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
4. Heme :
Has remained [**Doctor or Patient Name 11**] above 30 without any need for further transfusions .
5. ID :
The patient was initially started on Levo 250 mg q.d. for a UTI .
The patient with a history of MRSA left lower lobe pneumonia .
We have a low threshold for starting antibiotics ; however , chest x-ray reveals [**Hospital Customize **] acute changes and the patient remained 96% on room air throughout this admission without any stigmata over recurrent pneumonia including cough , dyspnea or shortness of breath .
The patient came in with a creatinine that was elevated at 2.6 .
His baseline was 1.8-2.2 likely pre renal azotemia and subsequently his creatinine improved with hydration and the packed red blood cell transfusions , and his creatinine steadily decreased down to his baseline .
1. The patient is to follow up with PCP , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Toob Obestimeuph</PHI> in two weeks .
2. The patient is to follow up with the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Genearocktemp Ry Health</PHI> GI Service in four weeks .
The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation for further recuperation and physical rehabilitation .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1) [**Doctor or Patient Name **] LOWER EXTREMITY PSEUDOMONAS CELLULITIS .
3) [**Doctor or Patient Name **] COMPRESSION .
4) STEROID INDUCED DIABETES MELLITUS .
This is a 59-year-old white male .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with [**Hospital Customize **] [**Doctor or Patient Name 33**] compression at that time .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
There was evidence of [**Doctor or Patient Name 33**] compression .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] , nausea or vomiting , chest [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] or shortness of breath .
He was taken to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Huyychestleme Health Of</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Scoo , [**Hospital Customize 297**]</PHI> where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital 227**] Medical Center</PHI> &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .
4) Chronic renal insufficiency .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Positive for diabetes mellitus .
ALLERGIES :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Cardiac exam was regular S1 and S2 , [**Hospital Customize **] murmur .
Extremities reveal the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .
Cranial nerves intact .
Coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .
LABORATORY DATA :
UA showed [**Hospital Customize **] white blood cells , positive granular casts .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural [**Doctor or Patient Name 28**] at the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
These findings were consistent with the [**Doctor or Patient Name 33**] compression .
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of [**Hospital Customize 64**] , the patient has extreme [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">[**08-19**]</PHI>/97
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Of [**Hospital Customize 64**] , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his Parkinson &apos;s disease .
His wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 .
He was recently started on a [**Hospital Customize 51**] catheter for urinary incontinence at [**Doctor or Patient Name 15**] .
He has [**Hospital Customize **] symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , [**Hospital Customize **] new medications .
ALLERGIES :
He had [**Hospital Customize **] known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .
There was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from Ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia .
He was continued on his Parkinson &apos;s medications .
Bedside swallow [**Doctor or Patient Name 75**] was done which showed him to have some aspiration .
He again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated .
He was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .
An electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased ST segment and left anterior ST depressions .
RV leads were negative for ST elevation .
A chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .
A portable echo showed [**Hospital Customize **] pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .
Anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .
The [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] coronary artery .
The patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .
He surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .
The patient continued fairly [**Doctor or Patient Name 11**] while intubated .
Two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with [**Doctor or Patient Name 11**] blood pressure on a very small amount of Dobutamine .
An echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] or left ventriculus .
They did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .
The repeat echo showed [**Hospital Customize **] improvement in left ventricle or [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .
Discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .
He was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .

1. hypertension ,
2. difficulty [**Doctor or Patient Name 60**] ,
4. history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , two prior episodes .
The patient has [**Hospital Customize **] known drug allergies .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was negative .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .
He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was [**Doctor or Patient Name 77**] and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] .
An X-ray at the time revealed free air .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction .

DISCHARGE DATE :
Gastric ulcer and gastric pericardial fistula , constricting pericarditis , adult respiratory distress syndrome , status post gunshot wounds and paraplegia since [**1991**] of T4 on down .
He has multiple decubiti on his buttocks and penis .
He had a gastric pull up in [**1992**] of the stomach into the left thorax and he has a transverse colostomy and a sinus tract on the abdomen .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Dakin &apos;s solution 1/4 strength to ulcer of penis .
Benadryl 50 mg. intravenous tid prn .
[**Signature **] capsule 1 [**Doctor or Patient Name **]. tid .
Lasix prn .
The patient is a 25 year old who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer .
He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression .
Otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-11**]</PHI> , 1995 that showed abnormal [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] of 64% .
There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] atrial dilatation .
The [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of constrictive physiology which was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-06**]</PHI> , 1995 .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal .
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor or Patient Name 312**]</PHI> of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
However he is able to swallow and tolerate [**Doctor or Patient Name **]&apos;s .
He just claims to have [**Hospital Customize **] appetite and has very poor effort with feeding .
The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three [**Doctor or Patient Name 3**] daily wet to dry dressing changes .
The patient &apos;s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased .
The patient &apos;s white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits .
His most recent cultures are negative .
The patient has been very closely with the [**Doctor or Patient Name **] Service here while admitted .
The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued .
The patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior .
Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
Nortriptyline 25 mg. [**Doctor or Patient Name **]. qhs .
Prilosec 20 mg. [**Doctor or Patient Name **]. qd .

MULTISYSTEM ORGAN FAILURE .
SEPSIS .
TIME OF DEATH :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
He has a long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy , presumably due to alcohol .
He has also had atrial fibrillation since [**1990**] , which has been rate controlled on Digoxin .
He was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon following an episode of bright red blood per rectum and 3.5-cm. sessile lesion at 27 cm. , which was biopsied through a colonoscopy , which revealed adenocarcinoma .
Adenocarcinoma of the colon .
Peripheral vascular disease .
Cipro 250 mg. b.i.d.
Sulfa medications .
Blood pressure was 104/66 .
Heart rate was 110 .
His heart rate was irregularly with a [**02-06**] holosystolic murmur .
After many discussions between Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leickgrend</PHI> , the patient , and his family , concerning the severely high risk , given the patient &apos;s conditions , it was decided to proceed with the operation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-27**]</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .
He continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator .
He was finally extubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**05-10**]</PHI>/95 , and despite respiratory rates in the 30s and very coarse , rhonchorous breath sounds , the patient continued to have acceptable oxygen saturation and acceptable blood gases on minimal oxygen .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**05-15**]</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Angio Suite for an attempted transhepatic internal jugular porta caval shunt .
His portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm. , going from 26 to 23 , so [**Hospital Customize **] shunt was placed .
His respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 314**]</PHI> &apos;s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine .
His urine output remained very low .
He had [**Hospital Customize **] carotid pulses , [**Hospital Customize **] gag reflex , and [**Hospital Customize **] pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .
The family was contacted and were present at his bedside .

3. Delirium ( adverse affects of opiates ) .
5. Deconditioning .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 208**]</PHI> admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in [**1997**] and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .
Not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but [**Hospital Customize **] visceral involvement .
On admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on room air was 92% .
She did look mildly dyspneic .
Her lungs were clear .
She was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .
Sodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 .
Her ALT 11 , her AST slightly up at 59 .
Her alk phos slightly up at 174 .
WBC 10.8 with normal differential .
Hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets [**Telephone/Fax (1) 315**] .
The patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of Zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .
She gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] was in the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] clavicle .
She also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral MRIs to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with [**Hospital Customize **] radiologic evidence for [**Doctor or Patient Name 33**] compression .
A single [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] to the collar bone seemed to help with [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] .
The sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks .
PLAN :
She lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .
The patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .
She was begun on Letrazole as an [**Signature **] inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of Xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">First</PHI> &apos;s office to have further discussions of this later approach .
Doculax 5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n. Colace 100 mg b.i.d. Senna syrup two teaspoonfuls b.i.d. Mylanta 15-30 mg p.r.n. dyspepsia .
Fragmin 5000 units subq b.i.d. Oxycodone controlled-release ( OxyContin ) 10 mg p.o. q.12 hours .
The patient was discharged in improved , [**Doctor or Patient Name 11**] , satisfactory condition with the expectation that she will call Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">First</PHI> &apos;s office for a followup visit in about two weeks .

Well healed [**Doctor 323**] scars and [**Hospital Customize **] masses .
Electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of tamponade .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] ventricle and low velocity paradox .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**06-14**]</PHI> and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was [**Hospital Customize **] need for a pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**06-18**]</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**06-19**]</PHI> , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**06-20**]</PHI> .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**06-19**]</PHI> and Ifex and Mesna on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**06-18**]</PHI> .
She was noted , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**06-16**]</PHI> , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of tamponade .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive [**Hospital Customize **] further Ifex .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
THER PROCEDURES :
arterial catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-14**]</PHI>/96 , head CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-14**]</PHI>/96
His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
Over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both [**Doctor or Patient Name 3**] slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
There was [**Hospital Customize **] known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 226**]</PHI> Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
[**Hospital Customize **] known drug allergies .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in World [**Doctor or Patient Name 329**] II .
4) old [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] frontal infarct .
He lives with his wife who is his primary care giver .
Tobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use .
Alcohol ; he has [**Hospital Customize **] recent use .
There was [**Hospital Customize **] history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was afebrile .
oropharynx was intubated with blood as well .
Abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds .
Extremities :
He does not regard the examiner .
According to the family this iansicoria was old .
He triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] .
His toes were down going .
SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
There was also evidence of an old [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] frontal infarction .
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did [**Doctor or Patient Name 173**] to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had [**Hospital Customize **] significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] frontal infarct , but there were [**Hospital Customize **] new lesions and [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is [**Doctor or Patient Name 110**] prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
After his initial intubation he remained quite [**Doctor or Patient Name 11**] .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
[**Name (NI) **] was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 226**]</PHI> and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .

These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-16**]</PHI>/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
NAME :
UNIT [**Doctor or Patient Name 7**] :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-15**]</PHI>/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
He subsequently had an echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-02**]</PHI>/98 he was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 369**]</PHI> with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .
He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .
An echocardiogram showed an ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
He denied any associated chest [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
NPH and CZI insulin .
Lisinopril 10 mg bid .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
He was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .
There was a grade [**01-06**] holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .
His abdomen was benign .
LABORATORY DATA :
There were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .
The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .
Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .
He was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital 370**] Hospital Center</PHI> who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .
Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-17**]</PHI>/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .
The patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-20**]</PHI>/98 .
Radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .
Following the procedure there was [**Hospital Customize **] further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .
He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were [**Hospital Customize **] associated palpitations .
He also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .
Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .
After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .
Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .
He did have a head CT which showed [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of a bleed or stroke .
Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .
He will have a visiting nurse to see him on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Iat</PHI> .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
Ecotrin 1 qd ( on hold until off of Coumadin ) .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
Oxybutynin 5 mg qd .

Started Campath in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> , 2001 , complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and CMV infection , and underwent MUD stem cell transplant in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> , 2002 .
The patient had bone marrow biopsy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> , 2003 , for persistent pancytopenia , revealing mild hypercelluarity with 80% leukemic cells .
Patient was hospitalized <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-26**]</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**11-11**]</PHI> for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head CT and MRI ) .
He has had recurrent CMB infection in the setting of Campath therapy , requiring IV Foscarnet therapy during stay , with inability to tolerate valganciclovir maintenance suppression subsequently due to increasing ARS .
Patient experienced acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency , with previous baseline creatinine 1.6 , felt to be due to medication toxicity , requiring Kayexalate and Phoslo to manage electrolytes , but never any need for hemodialysis , with mild improvement of creatinine by discharge , with peak creatinine 3.4 , discharge creatinine 2.6 .
Patient returns from rehabilitation after discharge on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**11-11**]</PHI> , with new fever up to 102.0 in [**Hospital 376**] clinic , increasing hepatomegaly as assessed by examination in clinic , and increasing creatinine .
Refractory CLL with bone marrow involvement , status post MUD , mini-allo stem cell transplant , <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> , 2002 , Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , recently treated with IV pentamidine and p.o. voriconazole , history of recurrent CMB infection , recent ARS on CRI , thought due to medication toxicity ( creatinine on discharge from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 197**]</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-16**]</PHI> was 2.6) .

Normoactive bowel sounds , soft , mild [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] upper quadrant tenderness , not dissimilar from week prior , pronounced hepatomegaly with liver edge 7 cm below costal margin , midclavicular line , [**Hospital Customize **] splenomegaly , [**Hospital Customize **] CVA tenderness .
Erythematous nodules on arms at elbows and on [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] thigh , as previous .
NEUROLOGIC :
Alert and appropriate .
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with [**Hospital Customize **] evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report .
A repeat CMV hypercapture , negative for presence of CMV .
A repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**11-09**]</PHI> , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .
In the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba .
Most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
Patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .
Pentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient &apos;s comfort .
DNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .
The patient was made comfortable with morphine for [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .
Tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
He recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had [**Hospital Customize **] true record of what was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter , however , works at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 197**]</PHI> and therefore the family elected to bring the patient [**Doctor or Patient Name 15**] and then bring her to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 197**]</PHI> .
She presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .
She did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .
She was febrile to 101.7 .
A lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
Negative .
Negative .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
Alcohol none .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Neck :
Revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant [**Doctor or Patient Name 28**] .
Hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
Regular rate and rhythm .
As noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
She was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and [**Hospital Customize **] distinct [**Doctor or Patient Name 28**] or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
She was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .
She went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .
She continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had [**Hospital Customize **] problems with her blood pressure during that .
Her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-03**]</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-04**]</PHI> revealed decreasing edema .
Examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .
Again , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
She was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had [**Hospital Customize **] further problems with her airway .
She was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .
Cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
Her mental status began to clear under the family &apos;s request .
Discharge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .
The patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .

He was admitted in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1994 , for biliary drainage catheter placement and balloon dilatation of what was thought to be an anastomotic stricture .
Biopsies and fine needle aspirates were suspicious for recurrent cholangiocarcinoma .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His lungs were clear .
The abdomen was soft and had well healed [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] upper quadrant scar .
He was admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics and studied with an abdominal computerized tomography scan .
The procedures took place on several days throughout the hospital stay with the sentinel pro cedure taking place on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-28**]</PHI>/95 , and this was placement of the 10 mm diameter metal wallstents .
Subsequent to that , he was found to have a subhepatic fluid collection , which was suspicious for a bile leak and therefore a drain was placed percutaneously into this collection .
His bilirubin by the time of discharge had fallen from a peak of 28 down to a discharge value of 8 .
He was covered prophylactically for the indwelling stents with ofloxacin 400 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 19**] b.i.d.

Discharge Summary
Report Status :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 404**]</PHI> has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .
His ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] was in the mid-50&apos;s.
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .
It was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .
He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to [**Doctor or Patient Name 15**] .
Following that admission in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .
He had a prolonged episode of typical anginal [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] and [**Doctor or Patient Name 20**] in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .
His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .
There is [**Hospital Customize **] history of drug abuse or smoking .
Of [**Hospital Customize 64**] , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
Of [**Hospital Customize 64**] , his prior work-up has also included screening [**Doctor or Patient Name 75**] for hypercoaguability with normal [**Doctor or Patient Name 14**] of protein S and C and an unrevealing [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] ventricular under myocardial biopsy .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He looked generally well .
His blood pressure l60/90 .
His jugular venous pressure was normal .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
Potassium of 3.2 .
Normal chloride and CO2 .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
the primary concern upon Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 404**]</PHI> &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-10**]</PHI>-94 , there he underwent [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .
The left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .
Coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 63**] of 35% .
He was ; therefore , [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor **] Tikfreierm</PHI> of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
After an extensive evaluation including in [**Doctor 405**] testing and flow cytometry of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 404**]</PHI> &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .
This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 404**]</PHI> &apos;s regiment .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .
There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] relief .
Because of the ongoing nature of his [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] .
He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] syndrome .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal [**Doctor or Patient Name 14**] of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .
Protein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .
It was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .
His anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .
He was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
Rheumatology felt that there was [**Hospital Customize **] good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small [**Doctor 406**] coronary disease and [**Hospital Customize **] further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .
He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] themselves .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
That was performed in the [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
He was then taken directly from the [**Doctor or Patient Name 35**] clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had [**Hospital Customize **] chest discomfort .
The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had [**Hospital Customize **] recurrent angina .
Therefore , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-27**]</PHI> , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aalv Sctroi</PHI> .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Unstable angina secondary to syndrome X .
Left thorascopic sympathectomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**05-21**]</PHI> and cardiac catheterization and coronary angiograph and left ventriculography on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-10**]</PHI> , 1994 .

THORACOABDOMINAL ANEURYSM .
DIS
Report Status :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
The patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**11-18**]</PHI>/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 416**]</PHI> which was evaluated with a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan .
The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-31**]</PHI>/93 via a [**Doctor or Patient Name 6**] femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but [**Hospital Customize **] aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .
On physical examination she is a well developed female in [**Hospital Customize **] distress .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Her chest X-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung [**Doctor or Patient Name **] .
Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium [**Doctor or Patient Name 14**] and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .
The patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at [**Doctor or Patient Name 14**] greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .
The epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and [**Hospital Customize **] return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .
The patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .
Continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested [**Hospital Customize **] other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .
Her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal [**Doctor or Patient Name 33**] and there was [**Hospital Customize **] evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .
Additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center</PHI> .
It is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .
Is satisfactory .

It appeared that there was a large tumor [**Doctor or Patient Name 28**] obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools [**Doctor 427**] colored .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at [**Doctor or Patient Name 15**] .
