DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Gait ataxia .
DOCTORS [**Name5 (PTitle) 91**] ORDERS :
WORK DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :
[**Doctor Regx **] peripheral neuropathy was [**Doctor Regx 47**] diagnosed in [**1989**] , cause undetermined .
Thoracic and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging study were normal .
The present admission was prompted by an episode of inability to walk at all for the past two or three days .
[**Doctor Regx **] computerized tomography scan done in the emergency room showed enlarged ventricles , suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus .
Pulse 72 and regular .
Blood pressure 154/90 .
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] aphasia .
He was unable to get up from the bed without help .
He swayed backward on the Romberg [**Doctor Regx 81**] .
Cranial nerves otherwise normal .
Plantars withal , possibly bilaterally extensor .
Mild decreased vibration and position sense in the toes .
Pin prick sensation decreased below the ankles .
Routine laboratory studies were negative .
The computerized tomography scan showed the findings described above .
[**Doctor Regx **] therapeutic lumbar puncture was planned on the day after emergency admission , but his gait was noted to be considerably improved at that time , and the lumbar puncture was postponed until <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-05**]</PHI> , at which time 40 cc were removed .
There was slight further improvement of gait , mainly [**Doctor or Patient Name 92**] unsteadiness , but [**Hospital Customize 4**] change in speed .
The gait was essentially what it had been before the episode of worsening prior to admission , moderate ataxia , slight flexed posture , very slight shuffling .
It was felt that this response and the presentation raised [**Doctor Regx **] definite question of symptomatic normal pressure hydrocephalus , but that this could not be diagnosed definitely at this time .
It was decided to continue to follow Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fyfeshuff</PHI> on an outpatient basis , with [**Doctor Regx **] follow up appointment in one month .

On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-15**]</PHI>/90 , he had [**Doctor Regx **] parietal headache at 8:00 [**Doctor Regx **].m. that was followed promptly by left-sided chest [**Doctor Regx 21**] without diaphoresis , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , or palpitations which lasted for an hour with awaxing and waning course .
His EKG showed an intraventricular conduction delay with anterolateral ST depressions and T waves inversions .
He was ruled in for [**Doctor Regx **] non-Q wave MI with peak CKs of 531 , positive for MB .
This course was complicated by [**Doctor Regx **] transient left bundle branch block on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-17**]</PHI> , atrial fibrillation despite his Quinidine .
Quinidine level on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-16**]</PHI> was 1.4 .
He had mild CHF , which was treated with Captopril and prn Lasix .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-22**]</PHI> , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital 71**] Hospital</PHI> for evaluation of his post MI angina .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Status post cholecystectomy , status post [**Doctor Regx 9**] inguinal herniorrhaphy .
ALLERGIES :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was [**Doctor Regx 21**] free and resting comfortably .
His neck showed [**Doctor Regx **] left-sided carotid which was 2+ without bruit , and [**Doctor Regx **] [**Doctor Regx 9**]-sided carotid which was 1+ without bruit .
His one-year examination had bilateral basilar rales greater on the [**Doctor Regx 9**] than the left .
Guaiac positive .
Pulses :
2+ femoral without bruit , 1+ dorsalis pedis on the left , trace dorsalis pedis on the [**Doctor Regx 9**] and trace posterior tibial bilaterally .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hemoglobin was 10.7 white cell count was 8.2 , platelets 211 , PT and PTT were 13.4/37.6 , Quinidine was 2.5 , and CKA was 53 .
He was [**Doctor Regx 21**] free with EKG ST depressions laterally .
Around 4:00 p.m. this occurred and he was given [**Doctor Regx **] beta blocker 2.5 mg IV push [**Doctor Regx 17**] four .
His heart rate went down to 60 .
At this time , he was also given 25 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name **] of Lopressor .
He complained of continued nausea and vomiting .
He had [**Doctor Regx **] good urinary output .
On the above chest x-ray [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of dissection was noted .
Atropine X 2 amps were given and the heart rate was in the 60s with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 to 90 range by Doppler .
Oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .
The patient was intubated and prior to intubation his rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .
Surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump .
Central access was gained and [**Doctor Regx **] chest x-ray was done which showed [**Hospital Customize 4**] pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as [**Doctor or Patient Name **] tube .
He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .
Atropine one amp was given .
At this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and [**Doctor Regx **] pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .
The family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .

ALLERGIES :
DOCTORS [**Name5 (PTitle) 91**] ORDERS :
Lasix 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
He had [**Doctor Regx **] very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and [**Hospital Customize 4**] noliguric renal failure .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .
Postoperatively , we measured [**Doctor Regx **] left ventricle ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .
He returned for routine office evaluation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-25**]</PHI>/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .
Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .
The carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of [**Doctor Regx **] basal heart murmur .
His chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , [**Doctor Regx 9**] greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .
The electrocardiogram showed [**Doctor Regx **] normal sinus rhythm with [**Doctor Regx 47**] degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**Female First Name (un) 110**]</PHI> , 1992 .
potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for [**Doctor Regx **] relative index of 6.9% .
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .
Over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 [**01-02**] lbs .
Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .
At the time of this study , the [**Doctor Regx 9**] atrial pressure was 1 , the [**Doctor Regx **] pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary [**Doctor or Patient Name 54**] pressure was 10 .
Left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .
There was mild mitral regurgitation , [**Doctor Regx **] posterior [**Doctor 111**] aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .
The aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .
[**Doctor Regx **] dominant [**Doctor Regx 9**] coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .
[**Doctor Regx **] large [**Doctor Regx 9**] ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in [**Doctor Regx **] retrograde fashion .
The posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .
The saphenous vein graft to the [**Doctor Regx 9**] ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had [**Doctor Regx **] minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
These findings were reviewed with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 112**]</PHI> and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate [**Doctor Regx 47**] choice in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 113**]</PHI> &apos;s management .
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .
It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 113**]</PHI> aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .
He is looking forward to returning [**Doctor Regx 22**] and going back to work on [**Doctor Regx **] part time basis at the local pharmacy .
We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wierst</PHI> and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .

Motor - [**Doctor Regx 9**] flaccid arm and he moved his left purposefully , but did not squeeze his hands .
He lifted his left leg off the bed , but [**Hospital Customize 4**] against resistance .
His deep tendon reflexes were noted for symmetric reflexes with upper extremities being 2 and [**Doctor Regx **] 3 .
He had clonus bilaterally with up going toe on the [**Doctor Regx 9**] , but not the left .
An erythrocyte sedimentation rate 3 , hematocrit 44 , white blood count 21.7 , lytes within normal limits .
There was [**Doctor Regx **] effect and some midline shift .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to then Neurologic Intensive Care Unit .
On admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was [**Doctor Regx **] large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] enhancement [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .
This was followed up with [**Doctor Regx **] bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .
The GI Service was consulted on this [**Doctor Regx **] and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .
This confirmed an 8 mm. [**Doctor Regx **] which was bright on T2 and homogeneous in the [**Doctor Regx 9**] lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with [**Doctor Regx **] benign hemangioma or cyst .
The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the [**Doctor Regx 9**] side and ability to walk with assistance .
This seemed to help him remarkably with increased activity .
His Decadron has been tapered slowly to zero and his examination on discharge was as follows :
He still spends [**Doctor Regx **] lot of time in bed , although easily arousable .
Speech was nonfluent with occasional single words .
He sleeps with [**Doctor Regx **] hypophonia , but occasionally will speak louder when he is in better spirits .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">[**07-21**]</PHI>/93 - mitral valve replacement and replacement of ascending aorta .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
There were transient mental status changes but [**Hospital Customize 4**] convulsions or loss of consciousness .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
There was [**Doctor Regx **] suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
She was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .
She was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of [**Doctor Regx **] pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent [**Doctor Regx **] barium enema .
She had [**Doctor Regx **] cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**07-13**]</PHI> , she developed [**Doctor Regx **] sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with [**Doctor Regx **] suggestion of an annular abscess .
After considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .
It was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .
Her valve was replaced with [**Doctor Regx **] St. [**Doctor 121**] Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
In the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .
The sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .
Her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .
With clotting [**Doctor or Patient Name 122**] replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was [**Hospital Customize 4**] longer [**Doctor Regx **] problem .
She remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .
Autopsy permission was granted .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient is an 80 year old female with [**Doctor Regx **] history of dementia , and of [**Doctor Regx **] choreoathetotic movement disorder of unclear etiology .
W / U for [**Location (un) 160**] &apos;s , ceruloplasmin , TSH , etc have all been negative in the past .
Patient was admitted to neurology service .
Infact , this medication was found to cause [**Doctor Regx **] significant improvement in her choreoathetotic perioral and arm movements .
She still has significant myoclonic component in her arms especially with volition , but this med will certainly be continued .
While essentially what we ARE hoping for in this use of the med is extra-pyramidal side effects , she should be monitored for any excessive or debilitating parkinsonian symptoms such as excessive rigidity .

She was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital 167**] Hospital</PHI> for change in mental status on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**07-19**]</PHI>/2002 .
Initial work up was unrevealing .
She was discharged to rehabilitation and developed disorientation , confusion , incoordination , and apparent paranoia .
Throughout her admission , she experienced occasional low-grade temperatures to 99 Fahrenheit with persistent leukocytosis .
There was [**Doctor Regx **] reported examination of her peritoneal fluid when fluid was being drawn for culture .

Herperitoneal fluid cultures have all been negative and showed only 3 polys .
There was [**Doctor Regx **] question of 3 x 4 collection around the peritoneal catheter that was investigated with an I+ abdominal CT scan that was not conclusive .
She was switched , however , to hemodialysis from peritoneal dialysis .
Work up also included [**Doctor Regx **] negative PPD , Clostridium difficile toxin , blood cultures , and head CT scan .
[**Doctor Regx **] Speech and Swallow evaluation initially deemed her an aspiration risk , and she was taken of [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] &apos;s .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for end-stage renal disease secondary to chronic urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis with vesicoureteral reflux .
And status post [**Doctor Regx 9**] nephrectomy , status post cholecystectomy , ____________thyroidectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 138**]</PHI> FROM <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital **] HOSPITAL</PHI> :
Include SULFA , CODEINE , TETRACYCLINE , NITROFURANTOIN .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She denies the use of tobacco or ethanol .
FAMILY HISTORY :
The patient was afebrile at 98.7 , blood pressure 128/64 , heart rate 96 , respiratory rate 22 , 02 s 96% on room air .
The oropharynx was moist .
The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm .
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] palpable lymphadenopathy .
The chest was clear bilaterally .
The heart had [**Doctor Regx **] regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , [**Hospital Customize 4**] murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] erythema around the catheter site .
There was only mild suprapubic fullness that was not tender .
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] guarding or rebound .
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] peripheral edema .
On neurologic examination , the patient followed only simple commands .
She had decreased strength bilaterally .
She answered appropriately to yes-[**Hospital Customize 4**] questions , but [**Signature **]
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included [**Doctor Regx **] sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 .
The hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 .
The differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes .
The electroencephalogram showed left greater than [**Doctor Regx 9**] frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .
As noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included [**Doctor Regx **] negative Clostridium difficile , [**Doctor Regx **] weakly positive D-dimer , [**Doctor Regx **] weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 .
Work up included from [**Doctor Regx **] neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .
In concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .
An lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .
For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .
For her FEN , the patient was able to take [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] &apos;s and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] &apos;s with one to one supervision .
From an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite [**Doctor Regx **] transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**08-10**]</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**08-12**]</PHI>/2002 , has had [**Doctor Regx **] white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .
[**Hospital Customize **] obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .
Excellent suggestions from Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx **]</PHI> of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient &apos;s weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .
However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .
CA-125 [**Doctor Regx 20**] were within normal limits .
We entertained the possibility of [**Hospital Customize 55**] [**Doctor Regx **] pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .
We will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .
Pending [**Hospital Customize 4**] further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Termarimed</PHI> pending [**Hospital Customize 4**] further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is [**Doctor Regx **] 77 year old female who has had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 215**] mitral valve replacement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-28**]</PHI>/76 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 216**]</PHI> .
In [**1988**] , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx **]</PHI> , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .
She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .
[**Doctor Regx **] TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .
Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize **]</PHI> for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .
This was on diltiazem and digoxin .
At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .
Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .
Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed [**Doctor Regx **] 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .
She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .
Therefore , [**Doctor Regx **] temporary pacemaker that put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**05-04**]</PHI> , and diltiazem was restarted .
It showed that she had [**Doctor Regx **] large big [**Doctor Regx 9**] dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .
The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into [**Doctor Regx **] large vessel .
The left anterior descending had perhaps [**Doctor Regx **] mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and [**Hospital Customize 4**] mitral regurgitation [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] on left ventricular angiogram .
This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four [**Doctor Regx 17**] [**Doctor Regx **] day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her [**Doctor Regx **] blood level of 1.0 .
We will ambulate her over the next couple of days .
We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite [**Doctor Regx 3**] .
If she remains [**Doctor Regx 3**] over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 217**]</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Em Neighburce</PHI> .

LABORATORY DATA :
Elevated left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology or duration .
The patient also had [**Doctor Regx **] shoulder film done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-10**]</PHI>/97 that showed [**Doctor Regx **] severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .
[**Doctor Regx **] lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing [**Doctor Regx **] fracture , was also [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] , and [**Doctor Regx **] CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-10**]</PHI>/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
EKG :
T - waves were also noted to be inverted in I and AVL .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
[**Doctor Regx **] bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did [**Doctor or Patient Name 32**] out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
After his procedure on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-17**]</PHI>/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-19**]</PHI>/97 to <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-20**]</PHI>/97 , and the [**Doctor Regx 47**] level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .

1) HIV positive with [**Doctor Regx **] CD4 count of 74 .
The patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and [**Doctor Regx **] former prisoner .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On presentation , the patient was [**Doctor Regx **] young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with [**Doctor Regx **] blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .
SKIN :
Jaundiced .
HEENT :
NECK :
Had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung [**Doctor Regx 237**] .
CARDIAC :
Showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and [**Doctor Regx 9**] upper quadrant tenderness .
His liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .
His spleen was not palpable .
NEUROLOGICAL :
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
PT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .
( On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-06**]</PHI> , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .
His chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be [**Doctor Regx **] cause of these abnormalities .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-10**]</PHI>/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-10**]</PHI>/91 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-11**]</PHI>/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-11**]</PHI>/91 .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
[**Hospital Customize **] other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-16**]</PHI>/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-15**]</PHI>/91 .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-18**]</PHI>/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.
DISPOSITION :
An autopsy will be performed .
An autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .

[**Doctor Regx **] KUB showed [**Doctor Regx **] large loop of dilated bowel but [**Hospital Customize 4**] free air and [**Doctor Regx **] tortuous calcified aorta .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and [**Doctor Regx 9**] bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 25</PHI> where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .
[**Doctor Regx **] urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .
[**Doctor Regx **] head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the [**Doctor Regx 9**] frontal and cerebellar lobes .
There was diffuse atrophy and [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient &apos;s diagnosis was [**Doctor Regx 44**] consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .
She was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .
However , she was unable to move her [**Doctor Regx 9**] arm or leg .
Her eyes were deviated to the left and she had [**Doctor Regx **] [**Doctor Regx 9**] facial droop .
[**Doctor Regx **] cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
Multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .
After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great [**Doctor Regx **] risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .
The patient did have [**Doctor Regx **] steady decrease in her hematocrit to [**Doctor Regx **] minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .
Her ferritin was 83 and there was [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of guaiac positive stools .
However , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] intake to maintain her volume status .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter felt that it was likely that her [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] intake would improve when she returned [**Doctor Regx 22**] to the nursing [**Doctor Regx 22**] .
I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .
The patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that [**Doctor Regx **] PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .
Nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing [**Doctor Regx 22**] .
I will get in touch with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx **]</PHI> and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .

dehydration .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
dementia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is [**Doctor Regx **] 75 year old female with [**Doctor Regx **] history of psychotic depression with paranoia who presents status post [**Doctor Regx **] few days of incontinence , increased confusion , and collapse .
The patient who has [**Doctor Regx **] baseline mental status / psychiatric impairment was reported to be increasingly confused and paranoid over the past few days .
Her [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] intake has also decreased .
The head computerized tomography scan on admission to the emergency room revealed moderate to severe cortical atrophy without evidence of acute bleed or subdural hemorrhage .
She does have paranoid features .
The patient has [**Doctor Regx **] history of near syncope in [**1988**] and also [**Doctor Regx **] history of dehydration .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with elderly siblings .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Elderly obese woman lying comfortably in bed in [**Hospital Customize 4**] acute distress .
The lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally .
regular rate and rhythm with normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :

She answers inappropriately to questions .
revealed sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 26.4 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose was 124 .
The amylase was 37 .
The complete blood count revealed [**Doctor Regx **] white blood cell count of 11,900 ; hematocrit of 38 and platelet count of 207,000 ; the tox screen was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Dehydration .
The patient was mildly dehydrated at time of admission and was replaced with intravenous fluids until she began taking good [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] intake .
2. Infectious Disease .
Therefore the patient was started on Bactrim for urinary tract infection .
She did not tolerate oral medication initially and was switched to intravenous ampicillin .
The antibiotics were discontinued after three days of intravenous antibiotic therapy .
[**Doctor Regx **] repeat urinalysis done later in the course of the hospitalization revealed [**Hospital Customize 4**] white blood cells .
The patient underwent neuropsychiatric testing .
Conclusion was that this was [**Doctor Regx **] dementing process .
The testing was performed by [**Doctor Regx **] staff neuropsychologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 270**]</PHI> , PhD , telephone [**Doctor Regx **] <PHI TYPE="PHONE">[**Telephone/Fax (1) 271**]</PHI> .
Approximately five days into the hospital stay it was noted that the patient had significant [**Doctor Regx 9**] parotid swelling .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so [**Doctor Regx **] contrast study was not available .
The patient was evaluated by ENT who felt that her enlargement was more likely secondary to an inflammatory process although they could not [**Doctor or Patient Name 32**] out malignancy .
It was felt that attempting [**Doctor Regx **] biopsy and beginning antibiotic treatment was not indicated at this time as the [**Doctor Regx **] had entirely resolved .
The ENT physician who saw the patient is Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 272**]</PHI> .
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 272**]</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**01-08**]</PHI> , 1994 at 1:20 p.m. at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- [**Hospital 273**] [**Hospital 2**] Hospital</PHI> .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has [**Doctor Regx **] long history of alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease as well as seizure disorder related to alcohol withdrawal and multiple <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 249**]</PHI> admissions for detox and multiple detox facilities in the past .
The patient also recently ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">06</PHI>/93 ) was diagnosed with infiltrating cancer of the hypopharynx and was scheduled to undergo XRT but had not yet started .
The patient also was noted to have secretions draining from his mouth .
He denied any shortness of breath at that time .
He was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 304**]</PHI> for further evaluation .
Despite multiple attempts at extraction at that point they were unable to extract the foreign body and it was felt that the patient should be admitted and attempt extraction later in the afternoon .
2) History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Hypertension .
4) Hypopharyngeal cancer .
5) Chronic [**Doctor Regx 9**] lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray noted to be probable scarring vs. fat pad .

HEENT exam revealed sclerae were injected , pupils equal and reactive .
Chest exam coarse upper airway sounds , [**Hospital Customize 4**] rales .
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
On admission Hct 42.1 , white count 7.6 , platelets 132 .
Dilantin level 13.7 .
SMA 7 was unremarkable aside from [**Doctor Regx **] glucose of 173 and [**Doctor Regx **] potassium of 3.1 .
By systems -
1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .
The patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .
4) Pulmonary - The patient had [**Doctor Regx **] clear chest x-ray other than [**Doctor Regx **] [**Doctor Regx 9**] lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .
The chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .
However , after aspiration given that the patient had [**Doctor Regx **] white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for [**Doctor Regx **] total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .
[**Hospital Customize **] organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .
It was thought that [**Doctor Regx **] Foley catheter would be [**Doctor Regx 44**] appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .
6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only [**Doctor Regx 17**] two and was difficult .

Psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .
He underwent extraction of all his teeth on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-21**]</PHI>/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently [**Doctor Regx **] GI bleed .
CBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .
The white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .
The last PT and PTT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-26**]</PHI>/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .
The patient had [**Doctor Regx **] chest x-ray which showed [**Doctor Regx **] few [**Doctor Regx 9**] upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and [**Doctor Regx **] follow-up chest x-ray on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-27**]</PHI>/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .
[**Doctor Regx **] faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .
OPERATIVE PROCEDURES :
Extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-21**]</PHI>/93 .
COMPLICATIONS :
2) GI bleed .

He had [**Doctor Regx **] normal bowel movement the day prior to admission .
History of small bowel obstruction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-17**]</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**07-15**]</PHI> , pancytopenia , history of [**Doctor Regx 9**] renal calculus .
Splenectomy , total gastrectomy as above , for gastric lymphoma for which he also received chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Epogen and Vitamin B 12 injections .
ALLERGIES :
[**Hospital Customize **] known drug allergies .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
PHYSICAL EXAM :
ABDOMEN :
[**Hospital Customize **] hernias .
The patient did have [**Doctor Regx 9**] costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted after placement of [**Doctor Regx **] nasogastric tube and was brought emergently to the operating room after [**Doctor Regx **] CT scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .
There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-13**]</PHI>/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be [**Doctor Regx **] slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .
This was taken down and the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .
However by the mid morning of the <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-14**]</PHI> , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .
The patient was invasively lined with [**Doctor Regx **] Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was [**Doctor Regx **] very limited exam .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-14**]</PHI>/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .
However prior to this it was also noted that the patient &apos;s scrotum was necrotic .
The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .
Upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had [**Doctor Regx **] septic-like picture and was maintained on Neo-Synephrine .
It should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have [**Doctor Regx **] pancreatitis by enzymes .
This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .
The patient &apos;s urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .
therefore the patient went back to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-15**]</PHI>/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .
The patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-16**]</PHI>/00 the patient had [**Doctor Regx **] completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as [**Doctor Regx **] last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .

Her skull was normocephalic and atraumatic , pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light , and [**Hospital Customize 4**] afferent pupillary defect was noted .
Extraocular muscles were intact with three beat lateral nystagmus bilaterally .
Oropharynx was unremarkable except for elevation of the left palate greater than the [**Doctor Regx 9**] .
NECK :
Showed fibrocystic changes bilaterally without discharge or skin change .
Clear .
[**Hospital Customize **] jugular venous distention was observed .
EXTREMITIES :
Without cyanosis , clubbing , or edema .
NEUROLOGICAL :
She spelled world correctly .
Her interpretation of proverbs was appropriate .
Visual acuity was 20/30 bilaterally with correction .
Fundi showed pale discs bilaterally requiring ten diopters to focus .
Extraocular muscles were intact , cranial nerve V was intact to fine touch bilaterally , and facial expression was normal and symmetric .
Auditory acuity was intact to finger rub .
There was [**Doctor Regx **] positive gag , tongue was midline , and shoulder shrug was decreased bilaterally , [**Doctor Regx 9**] worse than left .
Sensation was intact to fine touch [**Doctor Regx 17**] four extremities and proprioception [**Doctor Regx 17**] four extremities .
Reflexes were 3+ throughout except 2+ at the ankles .
Toes were upgoing bilaterally .
Triceps were 2+ on the [**Doctor Regx 9**] and 5 minus on the left .

Hip flexors were [**Doctor or Patient Name 92**] than 3 bilaterally .
Knee extensors were 3+ bilaterally .
Ankle dorsiflexors were 3 minus bilaterally and plantar flexors were 4 minus bilaterally .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission included [**Doctor Regx **] sodium of l4l , [**Doctor Regx **] chloride of l06 , [**Doctor Regx **] potassium of 4.3 , [**Doctor Regx **] bicarbonate of 26 , and [**Doctor Regx **] BUN of l0 .
Creatinine was 0.8 and glucose was 96 .
White count was 5.5 , hematocrit was 43.5 , and MCV was 9l .
EKG showed baseline artifacts , sinus tachycardia at l05 , PR interval of 0.l6 , QRS of 0.08 , QT of 0.36 , an axis of 60 degrees , poor R wave progression with transition after the V4 lead , T wave flattening in II and F , and T wave inversion in III .
[**Hospital Customize **] old EKG was available for comparison .
Cell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with [**Doctor Regx **] differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube [**Doctor Regx **] four and two white cells and 600 red cells with [**Doctor Regx **] differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube [**Doctor Regx **] one .
Patient also had an MRI scan of the head which showed [**Doctor Regx **] lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis .
The patient underwent <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital</PHI> multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .
She tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .
This was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .
She received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .
2) Anemia - Patient had [**Doctor Regx **] steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day [**Doctor Regx **] eight which remained [**Doctor Regx 3**] at this point .
Work-up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , [**Doctor Regx **] ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .
Haptoglobin was l79 with [**Doctor Regx **] normal bilirubin and [**Doctor Regx **] normal LDH .
This was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly [**Doctor Regx **] hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .
Patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .
[**Doctor Regx **] clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require [**Doctor Regx **] transfusion .
She did receive Bactrim for [**Doctor Regx **] urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .
Patient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , and the <PHI TYPE="DATE">Septemberth of 2006</PHI> to assure that her hematocrit recovers .
3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**08-15**]</PHI>/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
Subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .
Patient received [**Doctor Regx **] seven day course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .

REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The chest tube was removed , but then replaced on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-14**]</PHI> , and maintained [**Doctor Regx **] continuous and large volume output .
The patient was evaluated by the Liver Transplant Service , and on the end of his [**Doctor Regx 47**] week of admission , became increasingly somnolent with exam findings consistent with evolving hepatic encephalopathy .
This change in mental status remained refractory to medical management , and in the setting of recurrent spiking fevers and worsening renal function , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-17**]</PHI> , 1997 .
He has not been considered as [**Doctor Regx **] candidate for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 373**] or for pleurodesis , given his position at the top of the transplant [**Doctor or Patient Name **] for his blood type , B .
Early in his Intensive Care Unit admission , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Hibbslires</PHI> was intubated and ventilated , placed on broad antibiotic coverage including Vancomycin , Fluconazole , Ceftazidime , and Flagyl .
Blood cultures in this setting grew out Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic coverage was altered to cover this organism appropriately .
He became dependent on pressers .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-26**]</PHI> , the patient had an extremely large volume gastrointestinal bleed , and worsened hepatic encephalopathy .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-27**]</PHI> , the patient succumbed to overwhelming sepsis and anuric renal failure , and hypervolemia .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
2) PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION .
3) [**Doctor Regx **] COMPRESSION .
6) POOR NUTRITIONAL STATUS .
8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is [**Doctor Regx **] 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since [**1990**] .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 , the patient developed lower back [**Doctor Regx 21**] .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with [**Hospital Customize 4**] [**Doctor Regx 43**] compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 to <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back [**Doctor Regx 21**] , burning in nature with radiation around the [**Doctor Regx 9**] lower ribs .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from [**Doctor Regx **] chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**11-20**]</PHI>/94 of the spine showed [**Doctor Regx **] [**Doctor Regx 9**] posterior lateral epidural [**Doctor Regx **] extending from T9 to T12 .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 288**]</PHI> .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed [**Doctor Regx 9**] lower extremity [**Doctor Regx 21**] and could not walk secondary to the [**Doctor Regx 21**] .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s [**Doctor Regx 9**] lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the [**Doctor Regx 9**] lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal [**Doctor Regx 21**] , nausea or vomiting , chest [**Doctor Regx 21**] or shortness of breath .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on [**Doctor Regx **] Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
[**Doctor Regx **] Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , [**Doctor or Patient Name 54**] pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with [**Doctor Regx **] Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
1) Multiple myeloma .
3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .
5) Chronically low platelet count .
6) Failed autologous bone marrow transplant in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>/92 .
7) Hypothyroidism .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Married to [**Doctor Regx **] very supportive wife .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS :
HEENT exam atraumatic , [**Hospital Customize 4**] oral lesions .
Neck supple , carotids without bruits .
Abdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , [**Hospital Customize 4**] hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
Rectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , [**Hospital Customize 4**] perirectal lesions or erythema .
Motor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , [**Hospital Customize 4**] drift .
Coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the [**Doctor Regx **] reflexes , [**Hospital Customize 4**] reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .
Magnesium 1.7 .
Chest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural [**Doctor Regx **] at the [**Doctor Regx 9**] posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 249**]</PHI> and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
In addition , the patient received [**Doctor Regx **] five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**11-28**]</PHI>/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral [**Doctor Regx 9**] lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is [**Hospital Customize 4**] indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
The plan is to complete [**Doctor Regx **] full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has had [**Hospital Customize 4**] significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] when he is clinically better .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is [**Doctor Regx 44**] consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
His neurological exam remained [**Doctor Regx 3**] with [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-03**]</PHI>/94 .
He initially required [**Doctor Regx **] face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has [**Doctor Regx **] poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
[**Doctor Regx **] of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

Heart rate 60 , respiratory rate 18 , blood pressure 116/80 , temperature 97.1 degrees , oxygen saturation 93% on room air .
Skin examination was notable for [**Doctor Regx **] leg ulcer and cellulitis to be delineated below .
There were [**Hospital Customize 4**] spider angiomata .
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] S3 appreciated .
Vascular examination was notable for 1+ carotid impulses which were diminished and delayed and the above mentioned transmitted cardiac murmurs .
Abdominal examination revealed that the abdomen was soft , non-tender , non-distended , [**Hospital Customize 4**] organomegaly , [**Hospital Customize 4**] masses , normal active bowel sounds .
Neurological examination revealed that the patient was quite sedated at this time having received some medications .
She was arousable only to painful stimuli .

Coagulation studies revealed [**Doctor Regx **] PT of 17.4 seconds with an INR of 2.1 , PTT 25.5 .
The patient &apos;s admission chest x-ray revealed [**Hospital Customize 4**] infiltrate , [**Hospital Customize 4**] congestive heart failure .
1) Mental status changes :
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .
[**Doctor Regx **] neurologic work-up was undertaken which included [**Doctor Regx **] CT scan of the head which revealed [**Hospital Customize 4**] acute bleed and [**Doctor Regx **] lumbar puncture which revealed [**Doctor Regx **] glucose of 72 , protein 65 , white blood cell count 19 , red blood cell count 11,500 with [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of xanthrochromasia .
At the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s mental status is back to its baseline .

DIS
Report Status :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">[**08-29**]</PHI>-94
<PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-21**]</PHI>-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
end stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis .
2. perforated cecum ,
[**Doctor Regx **] heterotopic kidney transplant , placed in the left pelvic [**Doctor Regx **] and native left nephrectomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**08-29**]</PHI>-94 .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
1. colonoscopy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-05**]</PHI>-94 ,
2. colonoscopy with rectal tube placement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-07**]</PHI>-94 ,
4. renal biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-13**]</PHI>-94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
He started on dialysis in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/92 and has been maintained on it since .
He is currently on eight [**Doctor Regx 17**] per week hemodialysis .
The patient is status post left arteriovenous fistula creation .
3. gout ,
4. history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , two prior episodes .
Nephrocaps , 1 q.day , Colace 1 q.day , Allopurinol 100 q.day , Verapamil 240 mg q.day , Niferex 150 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] b.i.d. , Colchicine 0.6 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q.day , Phoslo 667 mg q.day , Cardura 1 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q.day .
The review of systems was negative .
The patient was admitted to the hospital on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-08**]</PHI>-94 ( please note that there is [**Doctor Regx **] discrepancy in dates here-transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the <PHI TYPE="ID">EXWAGH9T</PHI> protocol .
During this time , he never developed [**Doctor Regx **] fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .
An X-ray at the time revealed free air .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
[**Doctor Regx **] renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to [**Doctor Regx **] level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
At the time of this dictation , the patient is [**Hospital Customize 55**] quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
An echocardiogram revealed [**Doctor Regx **] dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .
[**Doctor Regx **] Holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .
The patient was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] in consultation and evaluated by Cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , Propanolol , and verapamil .
Again , he does have [**Doctor Regx **] history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .
Prednisone 20 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q.day , Imuran 25 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q.day , Acyclovir 200 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] t.i.d. , Bactrim one single strength [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] qhs , Maalox 15 cc [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] b.i.d. , Verapamil 80 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] b.i.d. , Cardura 4 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 300 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q.day , Clotrimazole 10 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] b.i.d. , Inderal 10 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] t.i.d.

DISCHARGE DATE :
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gastric ulcer and gastric pericardial fistula , constricting pericarditis , adult respiratory distress syndrome , status post gunshot wounds and paraplegia since [**1991**] of T4 on down .
The patient has [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 403**] filter in .
He had [**Doctor Regx **] gastric pull up in [**1992**] of the stomach into the left thorax and he has [**Doctor Regx **] transverse colostomy and [**Doctor Regx **] sinus tract on the abdomen .
Ceftazidime 1 gram intravenous q 8 .

[**Signature **] capsule 1 [**Doctor or Patient Name **]. tid .
Lasix prn .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is [**Doctor Regx **] 25 year old who has [**Doctor Regx **] history of [**Doctor Regx **] gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
[**Doctor Regx **] recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with [**Doctor Regx **] drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had [**Doctor Regx **] pericardial window .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he [**Doctor Regx 44**] likely had [**Doctor Regx **] gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-04**]</PHI> , 1995 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 404**]</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Win Shufffyfe</PHI> .
In lieu of [**Doctor Regx **] standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide [**Doctor Regx **] system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-11**]</PHI> , 1995 that showed abnormal [**Doctor Regx 9**] ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] of 64% .
There is trace pulmonary insufficiency .
The [**Doctor Regx 9**] ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of constrictive physiology which was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-06**]</PHI> , 1995 .
[**Doctor Regx **] copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
The patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge .
3. GI :
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has [**Doctor Regx **] colostomy .
The patient has [**Doctor Regx **] sinus tract that was studied with [**Doctor Regx **] fistulogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-25**]</PHI> , 1995 .
There is [**Hospital Customize 4**] fistula [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 124**]</PHI> of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
He just claims to have [**Hospital Customize 4**] appetite and has very poor effort with feeding .
It has been noted to be improving .
The patient has [**Doctor Regx **] Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three [**Doctor Regx 17**] daily wet to dry dressing changes .
The patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti .
These wounds should be treated with three [**Doctor Regx 17**] daily wet to dry dressings .
The patient remains on Fluconazole .
His [**Doctor Regx 44**] recent cultures are negative .
The chest X-ray shows [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of pneumonia .
The patient had [**Doctor Regx **] PCA and several other medications have been discontinued .
Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
Senokot two tablets [**Doctor or Patient Name **]. bid or Metamucil one tablespoon [**Doctor or Patient Name **]. bid .
Nortriptyline 25 mg. [**Doctor or Patient Name **]. qhs .

Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> is [**Doctor Regx **] 59-year-old gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , alcoholic cirrhosis , and rectal cancer , who was scheduled for [**Doctor Regx **] resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the [**Doctor or Patient Name **] team for improvement of his heart failure .
He has [**Doctor Regx **] long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy , presumably due to alcohol .
He has also had atrial fibrillation since [**1990**] , which has been rate controlled on Digoxin .
Adenocarcinoma of the colon .
Cirrhosis .
Mitral valve regurgitation of 4+ .
Tricuspid regurgitation .
Hyponatremia .
Peripheral vascular disease .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Lasix 40 mg. b.i.d. Tagamet 400 mg. b.i.d. Lisinopril 10 mg. q. day .
Digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day .
His temperature was 99 .
Blood pressure was 104/66 .
Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air .
His heart rate was irregularly with [**Doctor Regx **] [**02-06**] holosystolic murmur .
His chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one-halfway up the chest .
After aggressive diuresis on the Medical Service , he was deemed [**Doctor Regx 3**] for surgery .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-27**]</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent [**Doctor Regx **] sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .
His fluids were very strongly restricted , and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the Operating Room with 400 cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated .
He continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator .
He required some fluid boluses with D-5-W to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance .
His respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently .
At that time , multiple discussions were held with the family , and they decided to enact [**Doctor Regx **] Do Not Resuscitate order .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> &apos;s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine .
[**Doctor Regx **] Swan-Ganz catheter revealed an SVR of 350 , and he was started on Neo-Synephrine and Epinephrine prior to the Do Not Resuscitate order .
He had [**Hospital Customize 4**] carotid pulses , [**Hospital Customize 4**] gag reflex , and [**Hospital Customize 4**] pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .
The family was contacted and were present at his bedside .
[**Doctor Regx **] postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 268**]</PHI> admissions for this 88-year-old woman with [**Doctor Regx **] history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in [**1997**] and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .
She ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the [**Doctor Regx 21**] .
There had been [**Hospital Customize 4**] focal neurologic changes .
On admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on room air was 92% .
She did look mildly dyspneic .
She was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .
Sodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 .
Her ALT 11 , her AST slightly up at 59 .
Hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets [**Telephone/Fax (1) 407**] .
[**Doctor Regx **] CA 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .
She had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the [**Doctor Regx 47**] few days that had lead to the concern to [**Signature **] quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of Physical Therapy .
Her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .
The sudden plunge in such [**Doctor Regx **] dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately [**Doctor Regx **] small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks .
PLAN :

[**Hospital Customize **] masses and guaiac negative .
[**Hospital Customize **] edema or cyanosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .
PT and PTT were 12 and 26 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for [**Doctor Regx **] new pericardial effusion which was felt [**Doctor Regx 44**] likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was [**Doctor Regx **] concern and that [**Doctor Regx **] tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended [**Doctor Regx **] CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
They felt it was [**Doctor Regx 44**] likely [**Doctor Regx **] malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**06-14**]</PHI> and she developed [**Doctor Regx **] new junctional rhythm with [**Doctor Regx **] question of [**Doctor Regx **] new rub versus murmur on examination .
She should have [**Doctor Regx **] follow-up echocardiogram .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was [**Hospital Customize 4**] need for [**Doctor Regx **] pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that [**Doctor Regx **] bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**06-19**]</PHI> and Ifex and Mesna on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**06-18**]</PHI> .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was [**Doctor Regx 44**] likely steroid acne .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive [**Hospital Customize 4**] further Ifex .
She had [**Hospital Customize 4**] further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Granrivern [**Doctor Regx **]</PHI> is [**Doctor Regx **] 79-year-old [**Doctor Regx 9**] handed white male with [**Doctor Regx **] history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with [**Doctor Regx **] change in mental status and [**Doctor Regx **] fall at [**Doctor Regx 22**] .
His family stated that he had [**Doctor Regx **] progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
Over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had [**Doctor Regx **] drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , [**Doctor Regx 6**] [**Doctor Regx 17**] slipping off the edge of [**Doctor Regx **] chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth [**Doctor or Patient Name 92**] and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in [**Doctor Regx **] chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 [**Doctor Regx **].m.
There was [**Hospital Customize 4**] known incontinence .
[**Doctor Regx **] trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Coumadin 4 mgs [**Doctor or Patient Name **] qhs , Vasotec 5 mgs [**Doctor or Patient Name **] qd , Lasix prn , Digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , Proscar and Sinemet .

He lives with his wife who is [**Doctor Regx 42**] care giver .
He is [**Doctor Regx **] former professor at <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</PHI> .
Alcohol ; he has [**Hospital Customize 4**] recent use .
He has [**Doctor Regx **] father who had dementia .
head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .
His neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits .
Cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with [**Hospital Customize 4**] murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
Neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice .
His pupils were three down to two on the [**Doctor Regx 9**] and five down to four on the left .
According to the family this iansicoria was old .
He had left greater than [**Doctor Regx 9**] nasal stimulation to grimace .
He triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to [**Doctor Regx 21**] .
His deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the [**Doctor Regx 9**] brachial radialis and [**Doctor Regx 9**] [**Doctor Regx **] ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 .
His toes were down going .
SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
chest x-ray clear .
There was also evidence of an old [**Doctor Regx 9**] frontal infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did [**Doctor or Patient Name 340**] to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had [**Hospital Customize 4**] significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-18**]</PHI> , 1996 .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is [**Doctor or Patient Name 92**] prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be [**Doctor Regx 44**] likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had [**Doctor Regx **] very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
He remained chest [**Doctor Regx 21**] free throughout his admission .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on [**Doctor Regx **] high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
[**Name (NI) **] was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 260**]</PHI> and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with [**Doctor Regx **] soft solid diet with supervision .
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-19**]</PHI> , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and [**Doctor Regx **] of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have [**Doctor Regx **] terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be [**Doctor Regx **] short term procedure .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx **]</PHI> in clinic on one month time and the family is to [**Doctor Regx 41**] me if there were any questions in the interim .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CHORDOMA .
PROCEDURE :
He was taken to the Intensive Care Unit .
Now preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his [**Doctor Regx 9**] jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his [**Doctor Regx 9**] peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
DIET :
The patient is allergic to Codeine which causes nausea and Morphine which causes swelling .
Denies use of alcohol and tobacco .
He is married and lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nebraska</PHI> , works as [**Doctor Regx **] car dealer , has four grandchildren .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Heart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 .
General :
HEENT , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed [**Doctor Regx 9**] jaw incision , slight swelling [**Doctor Regx 9**] jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is [**Hospital Customize 4**] erythema .
Lungs are clear to auscultation .
Abdomen G-tube intact , soft non-tender , active bowel sounds .
Neurological alert and oriented [**Doctor Regx 17**] three , speech is fluent although there is some difficulty of tongue movement .
Deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing .
Cerebella intact .
Gait steady .
Postoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .
He was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used [**Doctor Regx **] rolling [**Doctor 152**] .
On postoperative day [**Doctor Regx **] eight he again reported leaking from the [**Doctor Regx 9**] nostril .
He vomited once and had intermittent headaches .
[**Doctor Regx **] head CT was done to evaluate [**Doctor Regx **] possible hydrocephalus , [**Hospital Customize 4**] hydrocephalus was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] where there was an old infarct in the [**Doctor Regx 9**] frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with [**Doctor Regx **] pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the [**Doctor Regx 9**] skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .
[**Doctor Regx **] lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .
[**Doctor Regx **] culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .
He was also receiving Ofloxacin for [**Doctor Regx **] presumed aspiration pneumonia and [**Doctor Regx **] Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to [**Doctor Regx 6**] Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .
He was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .
[**Doctor Regx **] video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .
Because of continuing complaints by Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 425**]</PHI> about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .
His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop [**Doctor Regx **] [**Doctor Regx 22**] jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .
1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .
He will have visiting nurse and [**Doctor Regx 22**] Physical Therapy services .
Follow-up will be with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx **]</PHI> in one weeks time .
He will needed [**Doctor Regx **] follow-up CT or MRI for the pseudomeningocele .

The patient was [**Doctor Regx **] 61-year-old white man with [**Doctor Regx **] history of mediastinal lymphoma who was admitted for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
The patient was diagnosed with lymphoma in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> of 1988 when [**Doctor Regx **] biopsy of her left cervical node revealed T cell versus Hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma .
He underwent intensive chemotherapy and entered [**Doctor Regx **] complete remission .
Significant for hypertension .
[**Doctor Regx **] mastectomy for benign lesion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed the patient to be afebrile with [**Doctor Regx **] blood pressure of 160/90 and [**Doctor Regx **] heart rate of 80 .
His lungs were clear .
The remainder of his physical examination was normal except for decreased vibration and position sense in the distal fingers and toes .
Hematocrit was 29.3 .
The remainder of his laboratory studies were normal .
His initial hospital course was complicated by the following :
He was treated with multiple antibiotics including ceftazidime , gentamicin , vancomycin and ampho .
2. Renal occlusive disease :
Starting on approximately day 14 , the patient developed signs of renal occlusive disease with increasing bilirubin .
This progressed inexorably until he developed massive ascites and marked hyperbilirubinemia .
Multiple abdominal ultrasound revealed [**Hospital Customize 4**] biliary dilatation ; there was evidence of gallbladder polyps versus stones on one ultrasound .
3. Renal failure :
Despite maximal efforts with coloids , renal range dopamine and Lasix , the patient &apos;s creatinine continued to rise .
Despite [**Doctor Regx **] very aggressive approach to his care , the patient continued to decline .

<PHI TYPE="ID">589-25-50</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
3. Acute thrombosis .
4. Transplant nephrectomy .
5. Pulmonary emboli .
7. Coronary artery disease .
9. Hypercoagulable state .
10. Perforated viscus .
12. Sepsis .
This required [**Doctor Regx **] transplant nephrectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
[**Doctor Regx **] pulmonary arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**01-03**]</PHI>/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely [**Doctor or Patient Name 92**] than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**12-19**]</PHI>/97 .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
For the concern of [**Doctor Regx **] perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**01-06**]</PHI>/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**01-08**]</PHI>/98 , at which time [**Doctor Regx **] gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five [**Location (un) 426**]-[**Location (un) 427**] drains into the retroperitoneal [**Doctor Regx **] , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to [**Doctor Regx **] variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name **]</PHI> continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his [**Location (un) 426**]-[**Location (un) 427**] site and [**Doctor Regx 9**] oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name **]</PHI> condition was irretrievable .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the [**Doctor Regx 44**] appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**01-16**]</PHI>/98 .

1. STAGE IV ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
2. STAGE III-C OVARIAN CANCER
1. STAGE IV ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
2. STAGE III-C OVARIAN CANCER
TREATMENTS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient underwent TAH / BSO , partial omentectomy at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 251**]</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>-90 .
At that time , tumor was found to be studding on the [**Doctor Regx 9**] diaphragm , gross tumor in the omentum and large bowel , tumor through the uterine serosa .
The question was whether or not whether she had two primaries vs metastatic endometrial cancer .
She was discharged from there on Coumadin therapy .
On admission , the patient has [**Hospital Customize 4**] complaints except anxiety .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
ALLERGIES :
The patient gets hives to aspirin and tomatoes also cause her hives .
The temp was 99.4 , BP 114/78 , pulse 128 and respirations 20 .
The lungs were clear to auscultation .
CV was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , positive bowel sounds , non tender , large , hard [**Doctor Regx **] occupying the lower abdomen and left upper quadrant .
The extremities were non tender without edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , the sodium was 136 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 98 , CO2 20 , BUN 8 , creatinine 0.8 and glucose 94 , ALT 5 , AST 10 , LDH 166 , alkaline phosphatase 81 , total bili 0.6 , direct bili .3 , albumin 3.3 , calcium 8.8 and uric acid 3.1 .
Her hematocrit was 31.1 , WBC 11.6 and 151,000 platelets .
The patient is thus stage IV endometrial and stage III-C ovarian vs metastatic endometrial for line II , cycle I chemotherapy IFEX , MESNA and VP-16 .
With the history of DVT , we plan Coumadin and check her coags .
The patient was tachycardiac on admission and it was felt she was dehydrated and / or anxious at the time of her initial evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent chemotherapy on the following doses :
IFEX 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days , MESNA 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days continuous IV infusion .
She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient &apos;s urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .
[**Doctor Regx **] repeat straight cath was negative for RBC&apos;s .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
The patient was counselled and received 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s at that time .
At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 .
She was restarted on Coumadin 2.5 mg per day .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is [**Doctor Regx **] 47 year old patient of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 434**]</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leebjescobe</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Co In Saorlirv Frea , [**Location 435**]</PHI> who was well until [**Doctor Regx **] bout of double pneumonia in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 436**]</PHI> .
He also has [**Doctor Regx **] history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
He had [**Doctor Regx **] transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .
[**Doctor Regx **] CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He was started on aspirin .
He has [**Doctor Regx **] family history of hypertension as well .
He was also placed on Vasotec .
[**Doctor Regx **] Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
unremarkable .
Carotids normal .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Nonfocal .
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 243 .
Cholesterol 197 , triglycerides 118 , HDL 31 , LDL 142 , total protein 6.2 , bilirubin 1.0 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , SGOT 23 .
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have [**Doctor Regx **] pulmonary [**Doctor or Patient Name 54**] pressure of 45 with [**Doctor Regx **] pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .
He had an 80% distal left main , [**Doctor Regx **] 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He developed epigastric [**Doctor Regx 21**] on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**07-31**]</PHI> which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .
The patient was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 437**]</PHI> , who said that he had [**Hospital Customize 4**] indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .
He had [**Doctor Regx **] left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , [**Doctor Regx **] single saphenous vein to the [**Doctor Regx 9**] coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and [**Doctor Regx **] saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**08-05**]</PHI> it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have [**Doctor Regx **] thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] , but he is clinically [**Doctor Regx 3**] on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged [**Doctor Regx 22**] .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin [**Doctor Regx 17**] and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew</PHI> .

On <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 249**]</PHI> .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and [**Doctor Regx **] PVR of 387 .
Consequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .
In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .
Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in [**Doctor Regx **] cardiac output of 4.4 with [**Doctor Regx **] SVR of 1300 and [**Doctor Regx **] [**Doctor or Patient Name 54**] of 16 .
Furthermore , due to the patient &apos;s long standing amiodarone therapy , and [**Doctor Regx **] positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .

The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 249**]</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-20**]</PHI>/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
The patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .
It was felt that the patient was not likely [**Doctor Regx **] good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital 453**] [**Hospital 454**] Hospital</PHI> which recommended EPS to [**Doctor or Patient Name 32**] out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient &apos;s arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the [**Doctor Regx 47**] 24 hours of the patient &apos;s hospitalization without difficulty .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-22**]</PHI>/94 an EPS study was performed .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-09**]</PHI>/94 .
Note , biopsies from the [**Doctor Regx 9**] forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Cultures were negative , and note , [**Hospital Customize 4**] pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .
There were [**Hospital Customize 4**] intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-10**]</PHI>/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .
At this point it was felt the patient would go [**Doctor Regx 22**] on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**03-13**]</PHI>/94 .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-23**]</PHI>/98
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
[**Doctor 456**]-Parkinson White Syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
His cardiac risk factors include :
He subsequently had an echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .
He subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1994 he had [**Doctor Regx **] paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .
He was diagnosed with [**Doctor 456**] Parkinson White Syndrome .
He underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 437**]</PHI> which were unsuccessful .
He was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-02**]</PHI>/98 he was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 457**]</PHI> with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .
He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .
He was discharged [**Doctor Regx 22**] but returned on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**09-13**]</PHI>/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .
Sotalol 160 mg bid .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
NPH and CZI insulin .
ALLERGIES :
He reports an allergy to [**Doctor Regx 6**] codeine and iodine .
There was also [**Doctor Regx **] question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .
However , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was [**Doctor Regx **] true allergy .
There was [**Doctor Regx **] grade [**01-06**] holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .
His abdomen was benign .
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
He was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital 458**] Hospital [**Doctor or Patient Name 8**]</PHI> who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .
His [**Doctor Regx 9**] coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to [**Doctor Regx 9**] collaterals .
His left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .
Mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .
There were [**Hospital Customize 4**] complications .
Following the procedure there was [**Hospital Customize 4**] further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .
In following up his ablation he underwent [**Doctor Regx **] Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .
There were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at [**Doctor Regx **] rate of 100 .
He also underwent [**Doctor Regx **] post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .
Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .
Accordingly he was [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] by Neurology who felt that there was [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of [**Doctor Regx **] secondary process .
He did have [**Doctor Regx **] head CT which showed [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of [**Doctor Regx **] bleed or stroke .
Given his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He will have [**Doctor Regx **] visiting nurse to see him on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Iat</PHI> .
Sotalol 120 mg bid .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
Oxybutynin 5 mg qd .
Zestril 20 mg bid .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is an 87 year old white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with [**Doctor Regx **] several day history of upper respiratory infection .
Of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .
He recommended that she see [**Doctor Regx **] local otolaryngologist .
There was also [**Doctor Regx **] question of [**Doctor Regx **] carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter , however , works at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 249**]</PHI> and therefore the family elected to bring the patient [**Doctor Regx 22**] and then bring her to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 249**]</PHI> .
She presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .
ENT examination was then to be performed .
Chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise [**Hospital Customize 4**] significant lesions at all .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
Smoking none .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She had [**Hospital Customize 4**] respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Oral cavity was normal .
Revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant [**Doctor Regx **] .
Neck :
The [**Doctor Regx 9**] pyriform was narrowed by edema .
The epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .
The patient had [**Hospital Customize 4**] stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .
There was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had [**Doctor Regx **] lesion in this area .
Lungs :
Clear .
Heart :
Regular rate and rhythm .
S1 and S2 , [**Hospital Customize 4**] murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , [**Hospital Customize 4**] hepatosplenomegaly , [**Hospital Customize 4**] bruits .
Extremities :
Normal .
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
Due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .
The patient was sedated .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only [**Doctor Regx **] large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and [**Hospital Customize 4**] distinct [**Doctor Regx **] or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the [**Doctor Regx 47**] 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .
Her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after [**Doctor Regx 6**] the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
She continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .
Her blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .
She was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .
She continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had [**Hospital Customize 4**] problems with her blood pressure during that .
Her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on [**Doctor Regx 6**] <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-03**]</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-04**]</PHI> revealed decreasing edema .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-05**]</PHI>/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had [**Hospital Customize 4**] problems .
She was kept on Ceftriaxone but [**Hospital Customize 4**] further steroids were given .
Examination at that time revealed question of [**Doctor Regx **] lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .
Of note , during her [**Doctor Regx 47**] hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .
Tube feedings were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-03**]</PHI>/91 and the [**Doctor or Patient Name **] tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-05**]</PHI>/91 prior to extubation to give [**Doctor Regx **] better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .
Again , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
It was felt that this was [**Doctor Regx **] mild episode of ICU psychosis .
She was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had [**Hospital Customize 4**] further problems with her airway .
She was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .
She had [**Doctor Regx **] geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that [**Hospital Customize 4**] formal consult will be found in this chart .
Nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had [**Hospital Customize 4**] further problems with her heart .
DISPOSITION :
She , of note , had [**Hospital Customize 4**] history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
If she does have [**Doctor Regx **] lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .
The patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is [**Doctor Regx **] 74 year old [**Doctor Regx 9**] hand dominant white female with [**Doctor Regx **] history of primary central nervous system lymphoma , diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1994 , status post twelve cycles of high dose methotrexate , status post two cycles of high dose ARA-C chemotherapy , who was admitted with [**Doctor Regx **] chief complaint of rectal bleeding and decreasing platelet count .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 1994 patient developed 2-3 months of headaches , cognitive changes , dizziness and [**Doctor Regx **] loss .
An MRI showed enhancing white marrow lesions at the bifrontal lobes on the [**Doctor Regx 9**] side , and rightsided basal ganglion in the [**Doctor Regx 9**] cerebral peduncle .
The patient was initially treated with high-dose methotrexate for six cycles .
However , the patient developed left IIIrd nerve palsy and an MRI showed increasing lesion in the left [**Signature **] cerebral peduncle and the left mid brain .
On the high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy , the patient developed bone marrow suppression requiring intermittent Neupogen ( GCSF ) support .
The patient was recently discharged from the hospital after her second cycle of high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy .
On the day of admission the patient &apos;s platelet count dropped to 28,000 and the patient was admitted for her platelet transfusions and further work up for her rectal bleeding .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**04-25**]</PHI>/95 :
white blood count 5,000 , hematocrit 38 , platelet count 50,000 .
66 polys , 8 bands with ANC of 1056 .
Sodium 136 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 103 , bicarb 26 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.7 .
The patient developed substernal chest [**Doctor Regx 21**] without radiation on the night of admission .
An electrocardiogram showed flat ST change in lead III , otherwise unremarkable and the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin without symptomatic improvement .
The patient was given 2 units of packed RBC along with the six units of platelet transfusion .
The patient &apos;s symptoms improved with the above measures and the patient [**Hospital Customize 4**] longer complained of chest [**Doctor Regx 21**] during the hospitalization .
The patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 76,000 on the following morning ; however , her white blood count dropped to 900 with 58 polys with 8 bands .
Because of significant neutropenia , the patient was put on reverse isolation and started on GCSF injections .
[**Doctor Regx **] GI consultation was made and they felt that the rectal bleeding is [**Doctor Regx 44**] likely from the hemorrhoids and [**Hospital Customize 4**] further intervention was felt to be necessary .
After the transfusion the patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 101,000 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**05-02**]</PHI> .
The patient had [**Doctor Regx **] follow up MRI scan which showed [**Hospital Customize 4**] significant change of tumor [**Doctor Regx **] .
However , in lieu of [**Doctor Regx **] persistent bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy , it was decided that she should undergo radiation therapy .
The patient was assimilated on the day of discharge and the patient will be started on radiation therapy in [**Doctor Regx **] few days .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Decadron 6 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name **] tid ; and she should continue Inderal , Synthroid and Zoloft at the present dose and frequency .

Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 499**]</PHI> has [**Doctor Regx **] long and complex history of coronary artery disease .
[**Doctor Regx **] subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed [**Doctor Regx **] 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .
His ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] was in the mid-50&apos;s.
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
He did well until he developed recurrent angina in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent [**Doctor Regx **] second PTCA with good results .
Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 501**]</PHI> with recurrent chest [**Doctor Regx 21**] .
He has had [**Doctor Regx **] progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] in the low 40&apos;s and radionuclide ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] estimated in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l994 at 31% .
He was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 501**]</PHI> with [**Doctor Regx **] typical episode of this discomfort in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
He was transferred at that time to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 260**]</PHI> .
That was his [**Doctor Regx 47**] <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 260**]</PHI> admission .
Because of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 499**]</PHI> &apos;s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .
He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-13**]</PHI> , 1994 .
There he had [**Doctor Regx **] [**Doctor Regx 9**] heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .
Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant [**Doctor Regx 9**] coronary artery or his left coronary system .
However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .
It was felt that the time that this study was [**Doctor Regx 44**] consistent with [**Doctor Regx **] syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .
Starting in the <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .
He had [**Doctor Regx **] prolonged episode of typical anginal [**Doctor Regx 21**] and [**Doctor or Patient Name 32**] in for [**Doctor Regx **] small Q wave myocardial infarction .
His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .
There is [**Hospital Customize 4**] history of drug abuse or smoking .
Of note , his brother had [**Doctor Regx **] myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He looked generally well .
His heart rate was 88 .
His abdomen was obese with [**Hospital Customize 4**] palpable organomegaly .
His femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .
Potassium of 3.2 .
His BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .
Glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .
His fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .
His liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .
His hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
the primary concern upon Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 499**]</PHI> &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
The left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .
Coronary angiography revealed [**Doctor Regx **] picture which was essentially unchanged from <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
Left ventriculography revealed [**Doctor Regx **] large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection [**Doctor or Patient Name 74**] of 35% .
Impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest [**Doctor Regx 21**] remained rather enigmatic .
He was ; therefore , [**Doctor or Patient Name 5**] in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 502**]</PHI> of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for [**Doctor Regx **] possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .
This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 499**]</PHI> &apos;s regiment .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at [**Doctor Regx **] higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
Repeat in [**Doctor 503**] testing of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 499**]</PHI> &apos;s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .
While in the hospital , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">[**Doctor or Patient Name 499**]</PHI> continued to nearly daily episodes of chest [**Doctor Regx 21**] .
These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .
There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete [**Doctor Regx 21**] relief .
Multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .
He was tried on [**Doctor Regx **] variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal [**Doctor Regx 20**] of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with [**Doctor Regx **] reference range of 80-120 .
Protein S was l14 with [**Doctor Regx **] reference range of 70-140 .
Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .
[**Doctor or Patient Name **] 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with [**Doctor Regx **] reference range of 50-200 .
Thrombin time and repalase time were normal .
It was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .
His anti-cardio lipen antibodies [**Doctor Regx 6**] IGM and IGG were within normal range .
His APC resistance was normal .
Rheumatology felt that there was [**Hospital Customize 4**] good evidence of [**Doctor Regx **] primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small [**Doctor 504**] coronary disease and [**Hospital Customize 4**] further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .
He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent [**Doctor Regx **] reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of [**Doctor Regx 21**] themselves .
His compliment [**Doctor Regx 20**] were normal and he had [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .
To evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to [**Doctor Regx **] permanent blockade procedure , [**Doctor Regx **] temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using [**Doctor Regx **] local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .
He was then taken directly from the [**Doctor Regx 21**] clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
After extensive discussions with the patient , the [**Doctor Regx 21**] service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with [**Doctor Regx **] surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest [**Doctor Regx 21**] syndrome .
Therefore , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">[**10-27**]</PHI> , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 505**]</PHI> .
He tolerated that procedure well and had [**Hospital Customize 4**] recurrent anginal [**Doctor Regx 21**] throughout the rest of his hospitalization .

THORACOABDOMINAL ANEURYSM .
Unsigned
Report Status :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">[**02-16**]</PHI>/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm .
HISTORY :
At that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal [**Doctor Regx 21**] and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 510**]</PHI> for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .
Since the patient &apos;s last admission she gives [**Hospital Customize 4**] history of chest or back [**Doctor Regx 21**] and continues to be quite active .
Her head and neck examination is within normal limits .
Her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
She has [**Doctor Regx **] pulsatile upper abdominal [**Doctor Regx **] .
She has [**Doctor Regx **] well healed [**Doctor Regx 9**] groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient &apos;s procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .
She had [**Doctor Regx **] [**Doctor Regx 3**] [**Doctor Regx 47**] postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .
Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium [**Doctor Regx 20**] and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for [**Doctor Regx **] heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .
The patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at [**Doctor Regx 20**] greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
She was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .
Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .
Laboratory data obtained revealed [**Hospital Customize 4**] significant changes from her initial postoperative [**Doctor Regx 20**] .
The epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and [**Hospital Customize 4**] return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .
Her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be [**Doctor Regx **] segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal [**Doctor Regx 43**] and there was [**Hospital Customize 4**] evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .
Social Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .
The patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .
She was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed [**Doctor Regx **] lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Is satisfactory .
(1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection .
During this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Lopressor 25 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] b.i.d. , Dulcolax tablets 2 [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q.[**Doctor Regx **].m. , Dulcolax suppository 1 [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q.o.d. , digoxin .125 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q. day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. , Tylenol 650 mg [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] / PR q. 4 hours p.r.n. elevated temperature , Benadryl 25-50 [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q.h.s. and Percocet 1-2 tablets [**Doctor or Patient Name 25**] q. 4 hours p.r.n. [**Doctor Regx 21**] .
The patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[**Doctor Regx 510**]</PHI> and she is to maintain rehabilitation care at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[**Hospital Customize 511**]</PHI> .
