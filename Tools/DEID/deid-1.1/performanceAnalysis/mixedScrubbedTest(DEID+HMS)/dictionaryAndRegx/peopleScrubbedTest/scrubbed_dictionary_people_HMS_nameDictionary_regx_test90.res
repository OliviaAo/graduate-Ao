ABDOMEN :
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .
