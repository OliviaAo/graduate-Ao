Cardiogenic shock .
The patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx white male with a family history of myocardial infarction and narcotic abuse with a large cell Pancoasttumor in cardiogenic shock after an anterior wall myocardial infarction .
Three weeks prior to admission , he noticed substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
19 days prior to admission , he was found to have a mass in the right upper lung on chest x ray .
Four days prior to admission , a bone scan showed right lateral rib positive .
Two days prior to admission to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> , he developed xxxxDATE22xxxx substernal chest pain which lasted 20-30 minutes .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 86/62 ; pulse 124 ; respiratory rate xxxxADDRESS8xxxx HEENT exam was benign .

<PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA .
The patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx , who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> after an anterolateral MI , with post MI stuttering chest pain .
His coronary risks factors are prior MI , smoking until he quit more than xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_10_100_DIV10xxxx ago , and adult onset diabetes with question of increased cholesterol .
At that time he was placed on Quinidine for his arrhythmia , questioned atrial fibrillation at that time .
He was ruled in for a non Q wave MI with peak CKs of 531 , positive for MB .
This course was complicated by a transient left bundle branch block on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> , atrial fibrillation despite his Quinidine .
He had a new apical systolic murmur noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> .
Status post cholecystectomy , status post right inguinal herniorrhaphy .
The patient was pain free and resting comfortably .
His neck showed a left sided carotid which was 2+ without bruit , and a right sided carotid which was 1+ without bruit .
His jugulovenous distention was to 10 centimeters .
His xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx examination had bilateral basilar rales greater on the right than the left .
Rectal :
Guaiac positive .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN and creatinine of xxxxDATE12xxxx , glucose 142 , hematocrit was 30 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx intubation ABG was pH of 7.39 , p02 81 , O2 saturation of 96% , C02 29 , total C02 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx intubation his pH was 7.32 with a p02 208 , and 02 saturation 99.7% , pC02 28 , total C02 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx 2.1 initially and during the code was 1.8 , cholesterol 144 , triglyceride xxxxADDRESS8xxxx COURSE :
He was pain free with EKG ST depressions laterally .
Around 4:00 p.m. this occurred and he was given a beta blocker 2.5 mg IV push times four .
Later , within an half hour the blood pressure dipped into the 70s systolic , and IV fluid was started .
The patient complained of pain between his shoulder blades and at this time IV fluid was increased , so was the Dopamine and Dobutamine .
Atropine X 2 amps were given and the heart rate was in the 60s with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 to 90 range by Doppler .
Surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra aortic balloon pump .
Central access was gained and a chest x ray was done which showed xxxPOSITIONxxx pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as NG tube .
At this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .
Autopsy was requested , however , the patient &apos;s family will not give xxxPOSITIONxxx their decision until tomorrow morning .

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE .
Unsigned
DIS
<PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/93
DISCHARGE DATE :
aortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfonamides .
cardiac catheterization - <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI>/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .
He also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .
Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .
Over these past xxxxAGE6xxxx , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .
He returned for routine office evaluation on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/93 , complaining of xxxxAGE6xxxx of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .
There was dullness at both bases , with rales xxxxDATE22xxxx way upon the right , and at the base on the left .
The right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .
The left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .
There was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .
LABORATORY DATA :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .
At the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure xxxxDATE22xxxx , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was xxxxADDRESS8xxxx aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .
The posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .
The saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .
Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .
It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .
He seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .

The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly .
Pulses were 2+ throughout .
The rectal tone was normal with xxxPOSITIONxxx enlarged prostate , and he was heme positive .
Neurologically , he opened his eyes with sternal rub , but not verbalization .
He did not have verbal communication and he did not follow verbal commands .
His pupils were asymmetric , 6 mm. to 4 mm. on the left , right pupil was 5 mm. reacting to 3 mm.
He responded to threat on the left , but not on the right .
The tongue was midline .
He had slight decreased corneal reflex on the right .
Motor - right flaccid arm and he moved his left purposefully , but did not squeeze his hands .
His deep tendon reflexes were noted for symmetric reflexes with upper extremities being 2 and patella xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was mass effect and some midline shift .
The patient was admitted to then Neurologic Intensive Care Unit .
Once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .
Given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar mass .
This was followed up with a bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest I minus on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/92 did not show the mass initially noted .
A testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for mass .
An abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non enhancing .
The GI Service was consulted on this mass and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .
He needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .
Speech was nonfluent with occasional single words .
He followed all commands readily .
He squints with his left eye when he tries to focus and claims this is because he sees double .
His left side was full .
He had marked dysmetria bilaterally , but left greater than right to finger to nose and his gait was very ataxic .
His deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the right with 3 right brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and patella .
A head computerized tomography scan was repeated on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/92 which revealed some resolution of blood . xxxNAMExxx he should return to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> to have a repeat head computerized tomography scan in xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx to further evaluate a possible mass lesion behind the hematoma .
The patient will be discharged to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Limestrict T xxxNAMExxx Medical Center</PHI> and will be followed by xxxxDOCTOR_OLDERxxxx Mo Muell</PHI> in xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx in the Neurologic Clinic .

This extremely complex xxxxAGE5xxxx was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
Further evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
There was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
There was xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .
In addition , she was evaluated by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Sileyer Medical Center</PHI> and there was xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of active dental infection .
She had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
Also , xxxPOSITIONxxx source for sepsis had been found .
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .
Accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .
Her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .
Her valve was replaced with a St. xxxNAMExxx Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
With clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was xxxPOSITIONxxx longer a problem .
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .
After consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/93 at 11:10 a.m.
Autopsy permission was granted .

The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in xxxPOSITIONxxx acute distress .
The blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury .
Her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .
The cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line .
The examination the abdomen was benign .
She had good pulses bilaterally .
There were non specific ST T wave abnormalities .
Following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty .
Therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
Coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy .
Specifically , there was xxxPOSITIONxxx decrease in the initial gain that she achieved after directional atherectomy .

<PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx 1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He was seen in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">FLFDMC</PHI> where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
2) Recent PCP .
The patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .
On presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature xxxxADDRESS8xxxx :
Jaundiced .
HEENT :
NECK :
LUNGS :
There was xxxPOSITIONxxx costovertebral angle tenderness .
Soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .
His liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .
EXTREMITIES :
GENITOURINARY :
NEUROLOGICAL :
ALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .
His chest X Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
The patient was admitted for work up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
Titers for CMV and Epstein Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre status and required less oxygen .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone . xxxPOSITIONxxx other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above xxxxADDRESS8xxxx , xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
DISPOSITION :
The patient died in hospital .

None .
WORD DISABILITY AND PROBABLY DURATION :
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> of xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
She also has a history of urinary tract infection .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left sided weakness .
There was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had xxxPOSITIONxxx pedal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
A KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but xxxPOSITIONxxx free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre renal azotemia .
A head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .
There was diffuse atrophy and xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient &apos;s diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
Her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed xxxPOSITIONxxx acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .
Her ferritin was 83 and there was xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of guaiac positive stools .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
However , with the assistance of the patient &apos;s granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .

6) SUSPECTED ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA .
The patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx with a long history of alcohol abuse , withdrawal seizures , and hypopharyngeal cancer now admitted with foreign body in hypopharynx .
He denied any shortness of breath at that time .
In the Emergency Room the patient underwent EGD by GI where a large piece of chicken was visualized at the level of the cricopharyngeus .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
2) History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
4) Hypopharyngeal cancer .
5) Chronic right lower lobe opacity on chest x ray noted to be probable scarring vs. fat pad .
6) Question of internal capsule CVA on CT scan .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission he is a disheveled elderly male uncooperative with the exam .
Vital signs revealed the patient was afebrile , blood pressure 150/90 , pulse 86 and regular , respiratory rate 24 , and oxygen saturation 91% on room air .
HEENT exam revealed sclerae were injected , pupils equal and reactive .
Chest exam coarse upper airway sounds , xxxPOSITIONxxx rales .

By systems -
The patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .
He was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient &apos;s mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .
Other options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient &apos;s poor prognosis for the future .
4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .
However , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total xxxxAGE6xxxx course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .
The patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .
5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .
The patient continued to be asymptomatic .
6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .
The patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .
These issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .
Psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .
CBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .

SUMMARY PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
DUODENAL PERFORATION
This is a xxxxAGE5xxxx gentleman with a past medical history of gastric lymphoma status post total gastrectomy / splenectomy in xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx with a Roux en-Y reconstruction .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
History of small bowel obstruction in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> , pancytopenia , history of right renal calculus .
ALLERGIES :
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 65 , blood pressure 101/74 , 100 percent oxygen saturation on room air .
There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .
This was taken down and the Roux en-Y anastomosis was re sited proximally .
There was xxxPOSITIONxxx other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
However by the mid morning of the <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE16xxxx /PHI> , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .
The Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .
Upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .
An incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .
Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .
therefore the patient went back to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .
Further debridement was undertaken .
Unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .
The patient &apos;s family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx ON DISCHARGE :

<PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx The patient is a seventy two-year old male with a history of diffuse atherosclerotic disease who had a coronary artery bypass graft in xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx followed a failed angioplasty .
He was admitted when he failed medical therapies for a diagnostic catheterization to evaluate his saphenous grafts and his native coronary circulation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The left femoral is barely perceptible , right femoral two plus with a bruit .
The abdominal aorta was approximately 4 cm .
LABORATORY DATA :
HOSPITAL COURSE :
With regard to his saphenous grafts , the saphenous vein graft to the LAD was patent , as were the grafts to LADD1 and to the marginal territory .
The patient had recurrent chest pain at rest in the hospital .
Antianginals were increased and including Procardia was increased to 90 q.d.
These changes in his medical regiment seemed to significantly improve his angina .
It was decided that he would be discharged on medical management .
We were very reluctant to recommend further invasive interventions in view of his dissuse atherosclerosis and renal failure , which make him a very high risk candidate for further PTCAs .
During the hospitalization the patient was dialyzed for his renal failure .
He received dialysis without complication .
The patient was anemic .
Activities as tolerated .
He is to be followed up by his private doctor .

The patient , after having his melanotic stool , had a question seizure like activity with question loss of consciousness .
The patient was transferred to the ED .
Of xxxPOSITIONxxx in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Genearocktemp Ry Health</PHI> ED the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 23.7 down from low 30s , a troponin of 5.8 , and an EKG with afib showing peak T waves . xxxNAMExxx the patient was admitted to the Medical Service for GI workup including possibly EGD .
Of xxxPOSITIONxxx the patient had a previously scheduled EGD for <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> .
Ischemia :
The patient is status post a non ST elevation MI , a troponin peaked at 22 likely secondary to dehydration and presentation of acute renal failure .
The patient was managed on a beta blocker .
Aspirin was held second to his concurrent GI bleed .
Lasix was given after each unit of packed red blood cells .
Overall , the patient had preserved LV function despite a large troponin leak .
Rate and rhythm :
A GI consult was obtained and the patient had adequate IV access .
Per GI consult given the patient &apos;s non ST elevation MI he would be a high risk candidate for a GI endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non ST elevation MI period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective GI workup in 4 xxxxAGE6xxxx .
The patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of bright red blood per rectum or large amounts of melena .
On admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1) RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY PSEUDOMONAS CELLULITIS .
3) CORD COMPRESSION .
4) STEROID INDUCED DIABETES MELLITUS .
This is a xxxxAGE5xxxx white male .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with xxxPOSITIONxxx cord compression at that time .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
There was evidence of cord compression .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Huyychestleme Health Of</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Scoo , Utah</PHI> where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lorough Medical Center</PHI> &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .
4) Chronic renal insufficiency .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Positive for diabetes mellitus .
ALLERGIES :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Cardiac exam was regular S1 and S2 , xxxPOSITIONxxx murmur .
Extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .
Cranial nerves intact .
Coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .
LABORATORY DATA :
UA showed xxxPOSITIONxxx white blood cells , positive granular casts .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
These findings were consistent with the cord compression .
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
In addition , the patient received a xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of xxxPOSITIONxxx the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
Both of these responded to xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Of xxxPOSITIONxxx he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his Parkinson &apos;s disease .
His wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was recently started on a xxxPOSITIONxxx catheter for urinary incontinence at home .
He has xxxPOSITIONxxx symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , xxxPOSITIONxxx new medications .
ALLERGIES :
He had xxxPOSITIONxxx known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .
There was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from Ampicillin pen g to aspiration pneumonia .
He was continued on his Parkinson &apos;s medications .
Bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration .
He again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re aspirated .
He was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .
An electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased ST segment and left anterior ST depressions .
RV leads were negative for ST elevation .
A chest x ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .
A portable echo showed xxxPOSITIONxxx pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .
Anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .
The right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery .
The patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .
He surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .
The patient continued fairly stable while intubated .
Two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of Dobutamine .
An echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus .
They did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .
The repeat echo showed xxxPOSITIONxxx improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .
Discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .
He was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .

She underwent a sigmoid resection on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/96 by xxxxDOCTOR_OLDERxxxx Lenni Pain</PHI> .
A chest x ray was read as clear .
She began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .
Her course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> .
An MRI was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/96 to rule out cord compression and showed xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of cord compression .
She presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> Emergency Room on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI>/96 with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .
She denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .
(7) Status post appendectomy .
(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo oophorectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Her abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .
An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .
However , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .
These findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .
On admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .
She was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .
She continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs .
However , repeated abdominal x rays and CT scans continued to show xxxPOSITIONxxx signs of obstruction or perforation .
However , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/96 she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued .
She was continued on bowel rest and xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on TPN .
After that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .
Her small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future .

2. difficulty hearing ,
4. history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , two prior episodes .
The patient has xxxPOSITIONxxx known drug allergies .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was negative .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .
He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .
An X ray at the time revealed free air .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take down .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction .

DISCHARGE DATE :
Gastric ulcer and gastric pericardial fistula , constricting pericarditis , adult respiratory distress syndrome , status post gunshot wounds and paraplegia since xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx of T4 on down .
He has multiple decubiti on his buttocks and penis .
He had a gastric pull up in xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx of the stomach into the left thorax and he has a transverse colostomy and a sinus tract on the abdomen .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Dakin &apos;s solution xxxxDATE22xxxx strength to ulcer of penis .
Benadryl 50 mg. intravenous tid prn .
______________ capsule 1 po. tid .
Lasix prn .
The patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer .
He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression .
Otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% .
There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation .
The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal .
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy . xxxxDOCTOR_OLDERxxxx xxxNAMExxx Vengloan</PHI> of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
However he is able to swallow and tolerate po&apos;s .
He just claims to have xxxPOSITIONxxx appetite and has very poor effort with feeding .
The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes .
The patient &apos;s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased .
The patient &apos;s white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits .
His most recent cultures are negative .
The patient has been very closely with the Pain Service here while admitted .
The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued .
The patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior .
Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
Nortriptyline 25 mg. po. qhs .

Blood pressure was 104 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx rate was xxxxADDRESS8xxxx heart rate was irregularly with a xxxxDATE22xxxx holosystolic murmur .
After many discussions between xxxxDOCTOR_OLDERxxxx Leickgrend</PHI> , the patient , and his family , concerning the severely high risk , given the patient &apos;s conditions , it was decided to proceed with the operation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .
He continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator .
He was finally extubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/95 , and despite respiratory rates in the 30s and very coarse , rhonchorous breath sounds , the patient continued to have acceptable oxygen saturation and acceptable blood gases on minimal oxygen .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS7xxxx for an attempted transhepatic internal jugular porta caval shunt .
His portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm. , going from 26 to 23 , so xxxPOSITIONxxx shunt was placed .
His respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> &apos;s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine .
His urine output remained very low .
He had xxxPOSITIONxxx carotid pulses , xxxPOSITIONxxx gag reflex , and xxxPOSITIONxxx pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">PUOMC</PHI> admissions for this xxxxAGE5xxxx with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment . xxxPOSITIONxxx long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but xxxPOSITIONxxx visceral involvement .
On admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on xxxxROOMxxxx  .
She did look mildly dyspneic .
Her lungs were clear .
She was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .
Sodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx ALT 11 , her AST slightly up at xxxxADDRESS8xxxx alk phos slightly up at xxxxADDRESS8xxxx 10.8 with normal differential .
Hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets 345 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of Zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .
She gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle .
She also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral MRIs to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with xxxPOSITIONxxx radiologic evidence for cord compression .
A single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain .
The sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx 
PLAN :
She lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .
The patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .
She was begun on Letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of Xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to xxxxDOCTOR_OLDERxxxx First</PHI> &apos;s office to have further discussions of this later approach .

His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
Over the five to xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
There was xxxPOSITIONxxx known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> Emergency Room where he was orally intubated . xxxPOSITIONxxx known drug allergies .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in World War II .
4) old right frontal infarct .
He lives with his wife who is his primary care giver .
Tobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use .
Alcohol ; he has xxxPOSITIONxxx recent use .
There was xxxPOSITIONxxx history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was afebrile .
oropharynx was intubated with blood as well .
Abdominal examination ; soft , non tender , non distended , normal active bowel sounds .
Extremities :
He does not regard the examiner .
According to the family this iansicoria was old .
He triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain .
His toes were down going .
SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
There was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency xxxxROOMxxxx mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had xxxPOSITIONxxx significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were xxxPOSITIONxxx new lesions and xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
However , this issue will need to be re evaluated in xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti coagulation .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE : xxxxDOCTOR_OLDERxxxx ORDERS :
The patient is to follow up with xxxxDOCTOR_OLDERxxxx Ria</PHI> in clinic on xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .

These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .

On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI>/98 he was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .
He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
He denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
NPH and CZI insulin .
Lisinopril 10 mg bid .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
He was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was a grade xxxxDATE22xxxx holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .
His abdomen was benign .
LABORATORY DATA :
There were also nonspecific ST T wave abnormalities .
The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .
Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .
He was seen by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nnoatal Hospital Center</PHI> who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .
Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively excitation .
Following the procedure there was xxxPOSITIONxxx further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .
He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were xxxPOSITIONxxx associated palpitations .
He also underwent a post procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .
Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .
After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3 xxxxAGE6xxxx following radiofrequency ablation .
Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .
He did have a head CT which showed xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of a bleed or stroke .
Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .
He will have a visiting nurse to see him on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Iat</PHI> .

Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Neck :
Revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass .
Hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
Regular rate and rhythm .
As noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
She was taken to the Operating xxxxROOMxxxx 00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and xxxPOSITIONxxx distinct mass or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. xxxxADDRESS7xxxx down to the Operating Room .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .

She was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had xxxPOSITIONxxx further problems with her airway .
She was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .
Cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
Her mental status began to clear under the family &apos;s request .

Discharge Summary
Report Status :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .
His ejection fraction was in the mid-50&apos;s.
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .
It was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .
He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .
Following that admission in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .
He had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .
His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .
There is xxxPOSITIONxxx history of drug abuse or smoking .
Of xxxPOSITIONxxx his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
Of xxxPOSITIONxxx his prior work up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He looked generally well .
His blood pressure l60 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx jugular venous pressure was normal .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
Potassium of 3 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx chloride and CO2 .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
the primary concern upon Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-10</PHI>-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .
The left ventricular pressure was l05 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> of xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .
He was ; therefore , seen in consultation by xxxxDOCTOR_OLDERxxxx xxxNAMExxx Tikfreierm</PHI> of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
After an extensive evaluation including in xxxNAMExxx testing and flow cytometry of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .
This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s regiment .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .
There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .
Because of the ongoing nature of his pain .
He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of xxxxSUSPICIOUS_NUM2xxxx .
Protein S was l14 with a reference range of xxxxSUSPICIOUS_NUM2xxxx .
It was felt that these results were non specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .
His anti cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .
He was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
Rheumatology felt that there was xxxPOSITIONxxx good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small xxxNAMExxx coronary disease and xxxPOSITIONxxx further rheumatologic work up was undertaken .
He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
That was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
He was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had xxxPOSITIONxxx chest discomfort .
The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had xxxPOSITIONxxx recurrent angina .
Therefore , on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by xxxxDOCTOR_OLDERxxxx Aalv Sctroi</PHI> .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Unstable angina secondary to syndrome X .
Left thorascopic sympathectomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> and cardiac catheterization and coronary angiograph and left ventriculography on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .

Report Status :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
The patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> which was evaluated with a chest X ray and abdominal CT scan .
The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but xxxPOSITIONxxx aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .
On physical examination she is a well developed female in xxxPOSITIONxxx distress .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Her chest X ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .
Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and xxxxADDRESS8xxxx patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .
The epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and xxxPOSITIONxxx return of significant function was noted over the ensuing xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .
The patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .
Continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested xxxPOSITIONxxx other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .
Her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .
Additional neurological follow up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center</PHI> .
It is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .
Is satisfactory .

It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools xxxNAMExxx colored .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .
