Metastatic breast cancer .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Dehydration , generalized anxiety disorder .
HISTORY AND REASONS FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This 75-year-old woman presented on week prior to admission with nausea .
An enlarged liver was noted and ultrasound and CT scan showed multiple probable metastatic lesions .
She presented on the day of admission with nausea and weakness and was admitted for observation and coordination of treatment .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was a weak , elderly woman in a wheel chair who could not walk without assistance .

On the breasts , multiple , erythematous , scaly plaques with underlying induration and inversion of the nipple on the right , left breast without masses .
Abdomen :
Liver span 12 cm firm with mild , right upper quadrant tenderness .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Included a hematocrit of 41 , a white of 10,500 , platelets of 298 , alkaline phosphatase of 162 , potassium of 3.3 and remaining liver function tests and electrolytes normal .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without abnormalities .
Chest x-ray was clear .
RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was begun on intravenous hydration shortly after admission because of very poor PO fluid intake .
Diagnostic work up included a fine needle aspiration of her right breast lesion which revealed ductal carcinoma , with estrogen and progesterone receptor status pending at the time of discharge .
She had a bone scan which showed multiple areas of increased uptake , particularly in L1 , L3 and L4 , as well as the left sixth posterior rib .
This corresponded to a site of pain reported by the patient .
Her abdominal CT scan showed multiple lesions in the liver with enlarged periportal lymph nodes , cholelithiasis , and a left adrenal mass thought to likely represent metastatic disease .
During her hospitalization , the main issues were pain control and nausea .
Her pain was ultimately helped most by a regimen of oxycodone and oxycontin , and nausea responded to p.r.n. Trilafon .
She was somewhat sedated on this regimen , and her standing Serax dose was reduced with substitution of Klonopin .
She was seen by Radiation Medicine for palliative XRT to the painful lesions in her LS spine , and radiation therapy was begun on <DATE>10/2/97</DATE> with the plan for approximately 10 daily treatments .
She required considerable encouragement to maintain PO intake , and required intravenous hydration to achieve adequate fluid intake during her hospitalization .
A Physical Therapy evaluation could not be completed because of her degree of pain and nausea .
She is being discharged to <HOSPITAL>Linghs County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> , with plans for continuing her tamoxifen pending estrogen receptor status availability which should be available within the coming week .
She will also continue x-ray therapy treatment and being physical therapy as tolerated .
