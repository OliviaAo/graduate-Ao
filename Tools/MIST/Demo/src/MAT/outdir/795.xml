DEATH SUMMARY
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION FOR LYMPHOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 61-year-old white man with a history of mediastinal lymphoma who was admitted for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
The patient was diagnosed with lymphoma in <DATE>January of 1988</DATE> when a biopsy of her left cervical node revealed T cell versus Hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma .
He underwent intensive chemotherapy and entered a complete remission .
In <DATE>08/89</DATE> , he developed B symptoms and work-up revealed relapse in the mediastinum , retroperitoneum , and bone marrow .
He underwent salvage chemotherapy and again went into remission .
He was then admitted on <DATE>9/20/90</DATE> for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for hypertension .
Right mastectomy for benign lesion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed the patient to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 80 .
Respirations were 16 .
His physical examination was noteable only for the following .
His lungs were clear .
Cardiac exam was normal .
Abdomen was benign .
The remainder of his physical examination was normal except for decreased vibration and position sense in the distal fingers and toes .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed a normal SMA-7 except for potassium of 3.1 .
His liver function tests showed a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 139 but was otherwise normal .
Hematocrit was 29.3 .
White blood cell count was 4.5 .
The remainder of his laboratory studies were normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent conditioning with Cytoxan , VP-16 , and VCNU .
His initial hospital course was complicated by the following :
1. Fever and neutropenia :
The patient developed fever and neutropenia without any clear source .
He was treated with multiple antibiotics including ceftazidime , gentamicin , vancomycin and ampho .
Despite this , the fevers persisted until he no longer was neutropenic .
2. Renal occlusive disease :
Starting on approximately day 14 , the patient developed signs of renal occlusive disease with increasing bilirubin .
This progressed inexorably until he developed massive ascites and marked hyperbilirubinemia .
Multiple abdominal ultrasound revealed no biliary dilatation ; there was evidence of gallbladder polyps versus stones on one ultrasound .
Despite aggressive supportive care , the patient &apos;s liver pathology did not resolve and he continued to have progressive hepatic failure .
Towards the end of the hospitalization , his bilirubins were in the high 30&apos;s and low 40&apos;s .
3. Renal failure :
Despite aggressive attempts to maintain his intravascular volume , the patient &apos;s renal function progressively declined .
He received multiple transfusions with coloids , including red blood cells and albumin .
Despite maximal efforts with coloids , renal range dopamine and Lasix , the patient &apos;s creatinine continued to rise .
4. Respiratory :
Because of mechanical limitations imposed by his ascites , the patient had severe tachypnea and required supplemental oxygen to maintain his oxygenation .
Despite a very aggressive approach to his care , the patient continued to decline .
Therefore , in close discussion with the family , he was made DNR .
The patient &apos;s clinical situation continued to deteriorate and he died on <DATE>11/9/90</DATE> at 4:30 a.m.
An autopsy was refused .
