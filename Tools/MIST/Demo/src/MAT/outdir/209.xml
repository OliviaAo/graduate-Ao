ATTENDING :

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS :
1. Visceral segment aorticpseudoaneurysm .
2. Severe restrictive pulmonary disease secondary to kyphosis .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Same .
ADMITTING SURGEON :
<DOCTOR>Nonok Ayrekempe</DOCTOR> , M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 78-year-old man who was diagnosed with a very large perirenal abdominal aortic pseudo- aneurysm on a CT scan that was ordered in the setting of dyspnea in .
The patient did have a history of previous AAA repair , and the CT revealed a large pseudoaneurysm in the area of the prior proximal anastomosis .
Given the size of the aneurysm , the patient was scheduled for a repair of the pseudoaneurysm .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Peripheral vascular disease .
2. History of DVT .
3. History of PE in 1997 .
4. Paraesophageal hernia .
5. History of TB which was treated in 1950&apos;s.
6. Kyphosis and osteoporosis .
7. Gastroesophageal reflux disease .
8. Upper GI bleed in 1997 .
9. Occasional dyspnea with mild aortic insufficiency .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
1. Triple-A repair in 1999 .
2. Paraesophageal hernia repair in 1997 .
3. ORIF of left hip in 1975 .
MEDICATIONS AT HOME :
1. Atenolol 50 q.d.
2. Fosamax 70 q.week .
3. Hydrochlorothiazide 20 q.d.
4. Nexium 20 q.d.
5. Zocor 20 q.h.s.
6. MVI q.d.
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room on <DATE>8/16/04</DATE> where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy with attempted repair of a perirenal aortic aneurysm which was subsequently aborted given the patient &apos;s complex aortic anatomy and the extensive scar encountered .
The patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
Please see operative note for more details .
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration and respiratory failure requiring intubation and ICU transfer .
The patient was noted to have a distal esophageal stricture near the site the of the prior paraesophageal hernia repair with a large esophageal dilation above that area .
This was thought to be the source of his multiple episodes of aspiration .
The patient underwent extensive treatment in both the ICU and the floor , which eventually resulted in extubation and placement of a PEG tube in order to pexy the stomach within the abdominal cavity .
This was achieved with good success , and the patient remained extubated on the floor for several days postoperatively .
However , on the morning of <DATE>9/5/04</DATE> the patient did suffer what appeared to be another aspiration event , became hypoxic and a code was called .
The patient was intubated and placed on pressors after administration of the ACLS protocol .
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent multiple rounds of the ACLS protocol without resolution of his hypotension , bradycardia or hypoxia .
After his aspiration event it was noted that the patient did develop ST elevation in the inferolateral leads .
Cardiology was consulted ; however , it was felt that this event was secondary to an aspiration event and therefore not a primary cardiac event .
Decision was made not to take him to the Cath Lab , but to medically manage him only .
Multiple attempts were made to resuscitate the patient using the ACLS protocol , which were unsuccessful in the setting of his coronary ischemia .
After extensive attempts at resuscitation it was noted that we were dealing with a reversible ischemia , and at that time the team did discuss further management with his family .
The patient &apos;s daughter did understand the current situation and understood that additional resuscitation attempts would be considered futile .
Despite administration of additional medications the patient remained hypotensive and bradycardic , and eventually became asystolic at 8:20 a.m. on <DATE>9/5/04</DATE> .
The family was at the bedside at this time .
The medical examiner has been contacted and a post has been requested .
