1. Endocrine-C-peptide neg. , glucose levels recovered to 200-230s with D10 at 75 cc / hr , then stable at 170s with no D10 .
We think that his hypoglycemia is likely attributable to his significant EtOH intake th e night prior to admission , along with his oral hypoglycemic meds .
We discussed his DM management with his PCP who was planning to institute lantus instead of glyburide .
