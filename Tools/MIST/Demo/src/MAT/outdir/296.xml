PROCEDURE :
Radiotherapy to the esophagus on <DATE>5/13/03</DATE> for four consecutive days .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several admissions for this 72 year-old female with metastatic unresectable esophageal cancer who is admitted with generalized upper abdominal pain of several days duration .
We have been seeing her fairly frequently in clinic , trying to give her some palliative chemotherapy which did not seem to work ( platinum and 5FU ) and she has had an anemia requiring transfusions on a regular basis every few weeks with heme positive stools .
On the days leading up to her admission she had not had many bowel movements but forced one with laxatives the night before admission .
The abdominal pain was slightly better after defecation but was not really influenced much by position or eating .
The bowel movement was dark .
She had nausea .
She was regurgitating some of her saliva from the lesion in her esophagus that was preventing her from swallowing .
She had some dyspnea that was continuing in spite of transfusions .
Her exam showed a blood pressure of 126/68 , heart rate 72 and regular , temperature 98.8 .
Her pain level was rated a 5 out of 10 .
She was pale and exhausted .
Old ecchymoses from a recent fall were resolving on her face and the laceration on her nasal bridge was also covered with scab .
Her tongue was moist .
Her JVP was less than 6 cm .
Her lungs were clear .
There was a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base .
Her abdomen was softly protuberant .
There was a few tingling bowel sounds .
The liver is 10 below the right costal margin at the MCL , firm and tender .
No hepatic rub .
Rectal ; good tone , empty vault but the material present is dark brown and guaiac positive .
Neuro exam ; positive for generalized weakness / deconditioning , but cranial nerves and mentation were intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included an abdominal film that showed nonspecific gas pattern .
Her sodium was 130 , potassium 4.2 , her BUN was 27 , creatinine 0.8 .
Her plasma glucose was 409 , her albumin 1.6 .
Her alk phos 816 .
ALT 53 , AST 113 , LDH 699 , white blood count was 17.3 with 85 polys , 12 lymphs , no bands .
Her crit was 21.6 and her platelets were 100,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was brought into the hospital and begun on IV fluids along with some clear liquids if she could tolerate them and her condition did not really improve , although she would keep reporting that each day she was a little bit better .
She was really too weak to get out of bed .
She only picked at her food and still had some dysphagia for solids .
Because of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and transfusions , we suspected that the esophageal lesion itself was probably the source of this bleeding and perhaps some palliative radiation therapy would both open the sphincter area for swallowing and staunch the bleeding .
To that end , external beam radiation therapy was begun and she tolerated it fairly well .
Some episodes of nausea , but only received about four or five doses of it without any marked change in how she felt .
Over this period of time , there has been tentative plans to try to get her closer to home to the <HOSPITAL>Lida Shonic,nsol Memorial Hospital</HOSPITAL> home or even to her own home , to be able to died in her own bed but this was not possible because the family felt uncertain about being able to provide enough safe care for her , even for a brief period of time .
Ultimately she became jaundiced and encephalopathic and the decision was to let her stay in the hospital .
She had previously established that she did not want resuscitation or intubation and this was abided by and she passed away in her sleep at 6:45 am on <DATE>5/22/03</DATE> .
The family was not interested in having an autopsy .
