DISCHARGE DATE :
<DATE>07/19/2001</DATE>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Inferolateral myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
1. Coronary artery disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
1. Single vessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent placement .
2. Coronary angiogram .
3. Right heart cath .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 44 -year-old man with a apical lateral ST elevation myocardial infarction with angioplasty and stenting of the OM-1 , transferred to the Coronary Care Unit .
The patient has no known prior history or cardiac risk factors but awoke at 2 AM with epigastric and chest discomfort which he had before but no associated symptoms .
He went back to sleep without any difficulty but awoke without incident feeling fine .
Prior to going to work at approximately 9 AM , he developed a different type of chest discomfort for which he took Tums .
At work , he continued to have left-sided chest pain with increasing intensity to 5/10 associated with diaphoresis and belching .
He was given Excedrin by a co-worker and ultimately went to <HOSPITAL>Nony Medical Center</HOSPITAL> at 10:30 in the morning where he was noted to have a mm. of ST elevation in 1 and L , as well as V5-V6 with ST depression in V1-V2 .
He was treated with aspirin , nitro , morphine with transient hypotension that responded to an IV bolus of fluid , started on Heparin and transferred emergently to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at <HOSPITAL>Ponta,itri- University Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Pneumonia in the 1980&apos;s but no coronary risk factors .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Notable for a blood pressure of 135/80 with a MAP of 100 .
Sating well .
Heart rate in the 80&apos;s.
Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat : : unremarkable .
Carotids 2+ without bruits , jugular venous pressure 8 centimeter .

LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for potassium of 4. , creatinine 1 .
Initial creatine kinase of 3765 and a Troponin of 6.5 , hematocrit 39 , platelets 305 , and lungs were clear .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was taken directly to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where coronary angiography demonstrated occlusion of a large bifurcating OM1 .
The rest of the coronaries were within normal limits .
The patient underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention of the bifurcating OM1 using a kissing balloon technique followed by stenting of the lower division of the OM .
This was an excellent angiographic outcome .
The patient received a bolus of Reopro followed by constant infusion and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit .
There , he was continued on aspirin , Reopro , Heparin , nitroglycerin , beta-blocker and folate , and a hypercoag panel was sent .
He did well overnight in the Coronary Care Unit with no further chest pain or shortness of breath .
Plavix was added to the patient &apos;s regimen , and he was tolerating his anti-ischemic regimen well and the beta-blocker was advanced and consideration was made for starting ACE inhibitor as well .
The patient &apos;s creatine kinase peaked at 3765 with 12% MB , and for markedly elevated triglycerides , he was started on Lopid .
He did well in the Coronary Care Unit and was ultimately deemed stable for transfer to the Step Down Unit for the remainder of his post-myocardial infarction care .
His beta-blocker was advanced .
He had a transthoracic echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 56% .
He was tolerating the addition of ACE inhibitor , was ambulating without symptoms , beta-blocker was advanced and he was ultimately deemed stable for discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Aspirin 325 a day .
2. Plavix 75 a day .
3. Folate 1 a day .
4. Lopid 60 BID .
5. Lopressor 60 BID .
6. Captopril 6.25 TID .
