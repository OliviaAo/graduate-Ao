She underwent a radical hysterectomy .
There were positive margins and positive nodes .
in <DATE>December</DATE> of l990 , she had a vaginal apex mass on examination .

Between <DATE>March</DATE> and <DATE>May</DATE> of l990 , she received two cycles of chemotherapy in two parts alternating Cisplatin and VP-l6 with Vincristine , Cytoxan , and Adriamycin .
In <DATE>June</DATE> of l990 , she underwent radiation therapy and in <DATE>July</DATE> of l99l , a right ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 48% .
Her chemotherapy was then changed to a single agent of Cytoxan .
Also in <DATE>July</DATE> of l99l , she had right hip pain .
There was a bony metastasis .
Orthopedic Surgeons did an open reduction and internal fixation of a lytic lesion involving the right femur .
On <DATE>July 30</DATE> through <DATE>August 4</DATE> of l99l , she received her first cycle of Ifosfamide and Mesna .
She had prolonged neutropenia and on <DATE>August 28</DATE> , she was admitted with a headache .

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Radical hysterectomy in <DATE>May</DATE> of l989 , open reduction and internal fixation of femur in <DATE>July</DATE> of l99l , and examination under anesthesia , cystoscopy , and proctoscopy in <DATE>December</DATE> of l990 .
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY :
Spontaneous vaginal delivery times three .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Zovirax 200 mg five times daily , Methadone 50 mg t.i.d. , and Ativan p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :

PELVIC :
By Dr. <DOCTOR>Friednantflirt</DOCTOR> revealed regrowth of the pelvic tumor .
There was a dry scaly rash with multiple small scabs on the left perineum and posterior thigh .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Her electrolytes were within normal limits , her BUN was ll , and creatinine was 0.8 .
Her ALT was l0 , total bilirubin 0.4 , and magnesium was l.8 .
Her admission CBC revealed a white blood count of 2.27 , with 56 polys and 3 bands .
Her hematocrit was 22.9 and platelets were l24 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for bone scan and blood transfusion as well as consideration of further chemotherapy .
The bone scan was performed which revealed multiple metastases to the spine , ribs , and skull .
There was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur .
Plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .
The Radiation Service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .
Planning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the Radiation Service .
She was also seen by the Dermatology Service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis .
She was given Synalar Cream and Eucerin Cream as a moisturizer .
The patient also received a unit of donor direct blood .
Due to Dr. <DOCTOR>Friednantflirt</DOCTOR> &apos;s concern that the tumor was growing despite the available chemotherapeutic regimen , the <HOSPITAL>Im Villtro University Medical Center</HOSPITAL> Medical Oncology Service was consulted .
They noted , as well , that she had failed the most active agents against small cell carcinomas .
However , they felt that at the <HOSPITAL>Venbonlea Health</HOSPITAL> , there were several possible options including a possible phase I trial regimen .
The plan at this time was made to further consider the options and the patient will follow-up with <HOSPITAL>Im Villtro University Medical Center</HOSPITAL> next week .
On the evening of <DATE>12/26/06</DATE> , the patient was discharged home in stable condition .
