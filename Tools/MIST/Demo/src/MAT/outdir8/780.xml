ADMISSION DATE :
<DATE>8-29-94</DATE>
DISCHARGE DATE :
<DATE>9-21-94</DATE>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
end stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. diverticulitis ,
2. perforated cecum ,
3. acute renal insufficiency .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
A heterotopic kidney transplant , placed in the left pelvic fossa and native left nephrectomy on <DATE>8-29-94</DATE> .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
1. colonoscopy on <DATE>9-5-94</DATE> ,
2. colonoscopy with rectal tube placement on <DATE>9-7-94</DATE> ,
3. subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch and ileostomy on <DATE>9-10-94</DATE> ,
4. renal biopsy on <DATE>9-13-94</DATE> .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 59 year old male with end stage renal disease from hypertensive nephrosclerosis .
He started on dialysis in <DATE>03/92</DATE> and has been maintained on it since .
He is currently on eight times per week hemodialysis .
The patient is admitted for renal transplantation .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post left arteriovenous fistula creation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. hypertension ,
2. difficulty hearing ,
3. gout ,
4. history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , two prior episodes .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Nephrocaps , 1 q.day , Colace 1 q.day , Allopurinol 100 q.day , Verapamil 240 mg q.day , Niferex 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Colchicine 0.6 mg PO q.day , Phoslo 667 mg q.day , Cardura 1 mg PO q.day .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was negative .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was unremarkable .
Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital on <DATE>9-8-94</DATE> ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here-transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the <ID>EXWAGH9T</ID> protocol .
His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .
He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
During this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .
Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .
An X-ray at the time revealed free air .
The patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .
He was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .
He therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
The patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated .
A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
At the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .
A Holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .
The patient was seen in consultation and evaluated by Cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , Propanolol , and verapamil .
Again , he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .
He did have some postoperative hypertension which was controlled with Cardura and sublingual nifedipine prn .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prednisone 20 mg PO q.day , Imuran 25 mg PO q.day , Acyclovir 200 mg PO t.i.d. , Bactrim one single strength PO qhs , Maalox 15 cc PO b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Verapamil 80 mg PO t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg PO b.i.d. , Cardura 4 mg PO b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 300 mg PO b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg PO q.day , Clotrimazole 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Inderal 10 mg PO t.i.d.
