1.) CV .
(I). Trop 0.15 , and TWI anterolateral , but likely has some demand w biventricular enlargement w chronic HTN and possible pulm HTN .
Also may have vasospasm w crack use .
Got lovenox 80 in ED , but likely doesn &apos;t need anti-platelet meds as yet .
-- Trop still 0.17 on 3rd draw , likely will take a long time to come down , still no indication for anti-platelet agents
-- ASA 81 , no B blocker because of recent crack use , fasting lipids <DATE>2/21/06</DATE> actually looked very good with LDL 91 .
ECHO <DATE>2/22</DATE> shows enlarged LV with EF roughly 25% , biatrial enlargement and moderate mitral regurgitation .
Started bumex ( patient preferred this to lasix because her father had lasix in the past and did poorly ) and lisinopril as an outpatient .
She was assigned to a new cardiologist Dr. <DOCTOR>Pulefreierm</DOCTOR> whom she will see one week after discharge .
-- BP control with captopril , converted to lisinopril for discharge . (R) .
NSR , no active issues .

No antibiotics were given and sputum culture grew oral flora .

Her family members were given phone numbers for all of her physicians to call if there are concerns that she is endangering herself with non-compliance in the future , at which time there may be further discussions regarding capacit / competency , and possible guardianship .
