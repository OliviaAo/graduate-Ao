An appendiceal CT scan was performed and showed appendicitis with an appendicolith with extensive inflammatory changes in the cecal region .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In summary , this was a 15 year old female with a history of right sided abdominal pain for five days with increased severity over the last 24 hours with an appendiceal CT showing appendicitis with extensive inflammatory changes .
The patient was admitted and started on triple antibiotics and ampicillin , gentamicin , and Flagyl .
She was scheduled for the operating room for an appendectomy .
The patient was taken to the operating room on the morning of <DATE>2/10/98</DATE> , at which time a laparoscopic appendectomy was attempted and then had to be converted to an open appendectomy .
The patient had perforated appendicitis with pus in the abdomen and a large amount of pericecal inflammation .
The wound was packed with wicks and the patient was then sent to the post anesthesia care unit and then the floor .
Postoperatively , the patient was kept NPO with a nasogastric tube and on intravenous fluids and continued on triple antibiotics with ampicillin , gentamicin , and Flagyl .
She had temperature spikes postoperatively .
The nasogastric tube was discontinued on <DATE>2/11</DATE> , which was postoperative day 1 .
The patient was started on sips of clears on postoperative day 2 .
Cultures from the operating room grew multiple organisms .
The patient was continued on triple antibiotics .
She continued with temperature spikes through postoperative day 3 .
She continued to have fever spikes on postoperative day 5 and an abdominal pelvic CT scan was obtained , which showed no intra-abdominal abscesses or fluid collections , but did show a right lower lobe infiltrate with atelectasis and bilateral effusions , with the right much larger than the left .
An infectious disease consult was obtained and the antibiotics were switched from tripe to intravenous Timentin .
The patient was started on vigorous chest physical therapy and ambulation was encouraged .
She had the Jackson-Pratt drain pulled on <DATE>2/17</DATE> .
The patient had low grade fevers with the switch of antibiotics until <DATE>2/17</DATE> , which was postoperative day 7 , when she had a temperature spike to 102.8 degrees .
She had a temperature spike to 102.5 degrees on postoperative day 8 .
The antibiotics were continued and a chest x-ray and CBC were obtained on postoperative day 9 .

500 cc of serosanguineous fluid were drained .
No pus was seen .
The chest tube was maintained on suction and postoperatively the patient was continued on Timentin .
Ambulation and central spirometry and deep breathing exercises were all strongly encouraged .
