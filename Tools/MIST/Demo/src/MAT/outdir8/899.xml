HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
The patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotics for possible cellulitis of the right hand .
She was initially given Ancef IV .
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the second day of her admission due to hypercarbic respiratory distress .
Her blood gas at that time was PH 7.26 , bicarb 93 , oxygen 70 , chest x-ray was felt to be consistent with fluid overload .
There was also a question of left lower lobe infiltrate and effusion .
She was also covered with levofloxacin empirically for pneumonia .
She was started on nasal BiPAP and repeat arterial blood gas on the BiPAP was PH 7.26 , PCO2 1.11 , and PO2 157 .
Her code status was visited with her family .
They felt the cause of her dyspnea was potentially reversible , and that she would want aggressive management at that time .
1. Respiratory :
The patient was intubated with goal of decreasing her PCO2 .
This was accomplished and her arterial blood gas improved PH 7.49 , PCO2 58 , and PO2 242 .
She had abronchoscopy on <DATE>09/18/2004</DATE> which revealed a left lower lobe basal segment tumor versus mucous plug versus edematous versus foreign body aspiration .
The patient self-extubated on <DATE>09/20/2004</DATE> and was maintained on intermittent noninvasive positive pressure ventilation until the time of her death .
