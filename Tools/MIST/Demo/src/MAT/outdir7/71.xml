The results showed focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents and was ? _ ? immune .

She was kept on a fluid restriction of 1000 cc per day for her poor urine output .
Patient was also put on a renal diet .
Patient had symptoms of epigastric pain , nausea , and vomiting probably secondary to her medications .
Slowly , however , that resolved and also , she had some encouraging signs of diuresis with decrease in creatinine and some improvement of her symptoms .
She continued to do quite well with her creatinine lowering finally to 2.8 on <DATE>01/04/97</DATE> .
The patient was therefore discharged feeling relatively well with her decreased creatinine .
