HOSPITAL COURSE :
Problem #1 was cardiac .
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and electrocardiogram .
He had multiple episodes during hospitalization of chest pain radiating to the back , during which his vital signs remained stable and there were no electrocardiogram changes .
His pain resolved with nitroglycerin sublingually and occasional MSO4 intravenously .
An exercise tolerance test was performed and the patient went 7 minutes 6 seconds and was terminated secondary to fatigue .
There was no chest pain , his peak heart rate was 150 , peak blood pressure 160/80 .
At the end of the test and in recovery , the patient had 1-mm of ST depressions in the inferolateral leads .
There were no arrhythmias .
Thallium demonstrated inferior , septal and apical filling defects with redistribution .
Given his rest pain and the results of the thallium , the patient went to catheterization , which demonstrated a left anterior descending with diffuse disease , a 60% proximal and 80% distal stenosis , obtuse marginal branch #2 with an 80% proximal stenosis , left anterior descending D1 80% , left anterior descending D2 80% .
A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed on the obtuse marginal branch #2 , with stenosis going from 80% to 20% .
Post-percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty the patient had recurrence of his chest pain and was returned for catheterization , which demonstrated patency of the obtuse marginal branch #2 .
The patient was started on diltiazem and Isordil and remained pain-free on these medications .
Problem #2 was diabetes mellitus .
The patient &apos;s blood sugars remained well-controlled with diet and 50 units of NPH every morning .
Problem #3 was fatigue .

There was a question of a depressive component to his fatigue .
Likely the fatigue is multifactorial .
He may benefit from a trial of tricyclic antidepressants .
