She had Q waves in V1 and V2 with biphasic T waves in V2-V4 and also noted were a Q wave in V3 and no ST depressions were noted .
There were slight ST elevation in V1-V2 suspicious for potential septal aneurysm .

Her T wave which had been inverted on a prior EKG now were upright across the precordium .
There was no change between her pain and pain free EKGs .
ASSESSMENT :
This is a 74 year old woman with a vague poorly defined history of coronary disease and EKGs and history consistent with previous myocardial infarction who now presents hypertension , tachycardia , nausea and chest tightness with EKG changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Hospital course by system :
1. CARDIAC :
The patient was placed on a cardiac monitor and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol .
She was placed on Nitropaste .
She was given Metoprolol 25 mg po bid .
She was up to 50 mg po bid for improved blood pressure and rate control .
Her creatinine phosphokinases were cycled and she did subsequently rule out for a myocardial infarction with CKs of 114 , 115 and 106 with isoenzymes less than .4 , She was taken off her rule out protocol and underwent an echocardiogram on <DATE>7/31/96</DATE> which showed an EF of 35% .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and dilated left atrium .
A diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with regional variations .
There was focal wall thinning and increased reflectivity of the anterior and midseptum suggesting scar .
The estimated ejection fraction as mentioned was 35% .
The right ventricular size and systolic function were within normal limits .
There was also noted upper septal hypertrophy without evidence of outflow obstruction .
Given these echocardiographic findings she was begun an ACE inhibitor , Captopril , initially at 6.25 mg po tid .
This was gradually advanced as her blood pressure would tolerate and her dose of transfer will be 25 mg po tid .
She also underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test on <DATE>8/1/96</DATE> which showed nondiagnostic EKG response to stress however there was noted an area of hypoperfusion consistent with an anterior infarct and there was no active ischemia .
She will be continued on an aspirin a day 325 mg po qd as well as Metoprolol 25 mg po bid .
Given her recent start on an ACE inhibitor she will need to have her electrolytes , BUN and creatinine followed q 1 week x 4 weeks to be certain that her creatinine and potassium not dropping secondary to the ACE inhibitor .
Given that she has had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure she has not been placed on diuretics .
However , she should be maintained on a low sodium diet and if she were to develop signs or symptoms of heart failure initiation of Lasix titrating to good urine output and adequate symptom control , could be necessary .
She will not be transferred on Lasix however given that she has clinically been without any evidence of congestive heart failure .2 .
NEUROLOGY :
From a neurologic stand point the patient was initially quite agitated and unfamiliar with her surroundings .
She was initially managed with prn Haldol as well as being maintained on her neurologic and psychiatric medicines including Depakote , Prozac , Klonopin and Trilafon .
She gradually became less agitated and more cooperative .
However , she does express frequent need for attention .
She appears to be somewhat depressed , also intermittently confused and calling out for the nurse .
In talking with her daughter and her sister it sounds as though these are baseline characteristics for this patient and she will continue on her current regimen .
3. HYPERTENSION :
From the hypertensive stand point she was initially maintained on Nifedipine as well as being started on the beta-block and ACE inhibitor as mentioned above .
The Nifedipine was discontinued on <DATE>8/1/96</DATE> in order to allow for pushing ahead with her ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker as tolerated .
Her blood pressure has been under control on these medications .4 .
ORTHOPEDICS :
She did have right knee pain and swelling .
She underwent right knee plain film x-ray which showed an insignificant right knee effusion , osteoarthritic changes and no evidence of fracture .
Her knee pain gradually improved and she was up and walking on the day prior to transfer .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
She will be followed by Dr. <DOCTOR>Nelson</DOCTOR> who follows her at the <HOSPITAL>Montden Hospital</HOSPITAL> .
She will be transferred on <DATE>8/2/96</DATE> in good condition .
Transfer Medications :
Metropolol 25 mg po bid , Captopril 25 mg po tid , Depakote 250 mg po qid , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po qd , Colace 100 mg potid , Prozac 20 mg po qd , Clonipine .5 mg po qhs , Trilifon 2 mg po bid and Darvocet 1 tab po q6h prn for pain .
Her diet should be low cholesterol and low sodium diet and she will followup as above .
