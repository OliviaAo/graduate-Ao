Chest xray shows bilateral pleural effusions , left greater than right .
CT scan of the abdomen revealed adensity in the portal vein as well as an abnormal area in the liver , consistent with possible infarct , although abscess and malignancy cannot be ruled out .
HOSPITAL COURSE ;
The patient was admitted and taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring .
He received approximately four units of blood transfusion and then maintained a hematocrit of greater than 25 .
The GI radiology service was consulted and on the morning after admission a TIPS procedure was performed .
At that time , the patient was noted to have a preprocedure gradient of 24 , a post procedure gradient of 9 to 11 .
He is noted to have a large left gastric varus which was embolized .
He had a nonocclusive thrombus in the right and left branches of the portal vein , however , the main portal vein , splenic vein , SMV , IMV were all patent .
He had a large recannalized umbilical vein and was dilated to 12 mm in diameter .
Post procedure , the patient did exceptionally well , he never had any sign of recurrent GI bleeds .
He was transferred to the floor in stable condition .
On <DATE>12/21/95</DATE> he was taken to the operating room at which time an EDG was performed which showed several smaller esophageal varices with two larger varices at the gastroesophageal junction .
There was no evidence of gastric varices .
These two varices were banded without difficulty .
Postoperatively the patient did quite well , he was kept NPO for 24 hours and then gradually started on clear liquids .
He is tolerating a soft solid diet upon discharge .
His discharge hematocrit is approximately 25.8 .
He has been restarted on his regimen of diuretics including Aldactone and Lasix .
The patient was noted to be fairly hypotensive throughout his hospitalization despite aggressive fluid resuscitation .
This is believed to be secondary to his Inderal dose .
Subsequently his beta blocker dose was decreased to 5 mg po qid and his discharge blood pressure is approximately 95/45 .
Additionally his potassium dose was decreased to 20 qd for his admission potassium of 4.8 .
He is continued on his Ofloxacin prophylaxis for SBP throughout his hospitalization and will be discharged home on this as well .
Notably while the patient has a small pleural effusion , he does not have any evidence of ascites at this time .
The patient continues to be a candidate for possible liver transplant and his evaluation for placement on the transplant list is still in progress .
The patient is awaiting a final evaluation from Dr. <DOCTOR>Sintnieves</DOCTOR> of the Addiction Services Team .
He was in Dr. <DOCTOR>Sintnieves</DOCTOR> &apos;s office at the time of his hematemesis on the day of admission and was seen again by Dr. <DOCTOR>Sintnieves</DOCTOR> while hospitalized .
He has been told to follow up with Dr. <DOCTOR>Sintnieves</DOCTOR> again after discharge .
Again , the patient is quite adamant that he wished to pursue liver transplant and will follow through with all physician recommendations as needed to insure his candidacy .
Notably , the patient did not develop any encephalopathic signs post TIPS procedure , however he was started on Lactulose to prevent any mild mental status changes .
