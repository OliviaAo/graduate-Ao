HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. <PATIENT>Walking</PATIENT> underwent thoracentesis by interventional radiology .
They removed 600 cc of yellow fluid .

Ms. <PATIENT>Walking</PATIENT> also underwent echocardiogram .
Her LV ejection fraction was 77% .
The estimated RV systolic pressure was 47 .
Because of a concern of a solid mass on the lesser curvature of her stomach noted by abdominal CAT scan , Ms. <PATIENT>Walking</PATIENT> had a GI consultation .
The gastroenterologist performed an EGD and EUS .
The EGD showed a normal esophagus , a submucosal mass in the cardia and fundus of the stomach with central umbilication , nodularity in the prepyloric antrum , and a normal duodenum .
The EUS showed a normal common bile duct , normal pancreas and a 4-cm gastric wall solid mass , which was hypoechoic , heterogenetic and lobulated in appearance .
She had biopsies taken , which are pending at this time .
Of note , there was an extensive differential diagnosis for her unilateral effusion including malignancy , tuberculosis , drug-induced lupus and less likely pestis related .
The exudative nature of the effusion argues against congestive heart failure or hepatic hydrothorax .
