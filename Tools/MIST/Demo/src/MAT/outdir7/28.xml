HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on <DATE>June 21</DATE> , and was taken to the Electrophysiology Laboratory , where she was found to have typical slow-fast AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia .
She had a successful radiofrequency ablation with modification of the slow pathway performed .
Following the procedure , the tachyarrhythmia could not be re-induced .
The patient was kept in the hospital overnight on heparin , and discharged the following morning on Aspirin for 4 weeks .
