ALLERGIES :
She had no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She had a temperature of 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit , heart rate 115 , and blood pressure 139/89 .
HEENT :
Oropharynx was clear , extraocular movements were intact , and pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light .
CHEST :
Lungs were clear to auscultation .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
ABDOMEN :
Positive bowel sounds , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly , no costovertebral angle tenderness , no hernia , and no rebound or guarding .
There was mild right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant tenderness and no masses palpable .
RECTAL :
Nontender and hemoccult negative .
PELVIC :
Examination showed no masses and mild cervical motion tenderness .
EXTREMITIES :
No cyanosis , clubbing , or edema .
NEUROLOGICAL :
No focal deficits .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Studies revealed that chemistries were within normal limits , white blood cell count was 20.8000 , hematocrit was 38 , and platelets were 272,000 .
KUB was performed in the Emergency Room which showed dilated loops of small bowel with no air fluid levels .
In addition , an ultrasound was performed of the right lower quadrant which showed no evident appendix .
The pelvis and pelvic structures were normal and there was a normal gallbladder and kidneys seen on the right .
Chest x-ray was unremarkable , urinalysis was negative , and beta HCG was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a principle diagnosis of likely perforated appendicitis .
She was admitted and put on intravenous antibiotics with plan of obtaining an abdominopelvic CT scan .
On the day of admission , an abdominopelvic CAT scan was obtained which showed dilated loops of fluid filled bowel and colon in the right lower quadrant .
The colon was decompressed distally and there was no contrast seen in the lower intestine .
This was thought to represent at least a partial small bowel obstruction or possibly an ileus .
There were some bubbles of free air which were thought to be extraluminal .
The primary diagnosis at that time was complicated or perforated appendicitis with partial small bowel obstruction .
A delayed CT scan was planned in order to follow contrast through the lower intestine and on this delayed CT scan , contrast was seen passing distally through the lower intestine .
At this time , on hospital day one with a diagnosis of perforated appendicitis and right lower quadrant phlegmon , it was felt that this course of action would be to either proceed with surgery or attempt to stabilize the patient with intravenous fluids , antibiotics , and possibly wait for six weeks for elective appendectomy .
The patient was started on triple antibiotics of ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl , kept NPO , and serial examinations were obtained .
Over the first three hospital days , her white blood cell count fell to under 10,000 .
Sips of clear liquids were started and were tolerated without complication .
Patient &apos;s physical examination remained relatively unremarkable , however , she began to develop slight abdominal distention .
After the patient was tolerating clear sips , she was given one liter of Golytely with the intention of clearing out her bowel in case surgery was needed .
Repeat CAT scan was obtained on hospital day five .
This CAT scan was relatively unchanged showing matted loops of bowel in the right lower quadrant .
The appendix was not well visualized .
The repeat CT scan also showed contained fluid collections in the pelvis and these were not felt to be communicating .
These were also not felt to be collections which could be drained by interventional radiology .
Given the progression of the patient &apos;s CAT scan and the relative nonprogression of her clinical course , the decision was made after discussion with the patient to proceed with exploratory laparotomy and likely ileocecectomy with secondary wound closure .
Patient &apos;s bowel was further prepared with p.o. erythromycin and neomycin base in one additional liter of Golytely .
She experienced extreme nausea and vomiting with the erythromycin and neomycin .
On <DATE>December 3 , 1997</DATE> , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and under general anesthesia , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy , drainage of intraabdominal abscesses , and appendectomy by Dr. <DOCTOR>Zamorryn He</DOCTOR> .
No ileocecectomy was performed .
Cultures were taken of the peritoneal fluid .
These peritoneal fluid cultures subsequently grew E. coli and coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
The patient &apos;s perioperative antibiotics ( ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl ) were continued .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the Recovery Room then subsequently to the floor .
Pain service consultation was obtained for perioperative pain control and a patient controlled analgesia was begun .
Patient &apos;s nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day one and by postoperative day two , the patient was out of bed and ambulating .
On postoperative day three , the patient was started on oral sips and by postoperative day four , the patient was tolerating over a liter a day of clear liquids and had had one bowel movement .
Her abdominal pain was dramatically decreased at this time .
She had no abdominal distention and no erythema around the wound .
Two Jackson-Pratts were placed intraoperatively .
At the time of this dictation on postoperative day four , the Jackson-Pratts had put out under 5 cc of discharge per day .
The patient is scheduled to be discharged tomorrow on <DATE>December 8 , 1997</DATE> .
Her Jackson-Pratt drains will be discontinued in the morning and the patient will be discharged on ofloxacin and Flagyl p.o. for a total antibiotic course of fourteen days which includes an additional nine days of antibiotics with the patient &apos;s operative date being considered day one of antibiotics .
