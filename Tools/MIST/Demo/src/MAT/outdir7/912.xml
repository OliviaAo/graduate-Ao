The proximal RCA was totally occluded with good left to right collaterals .
The LAD showed a 40% stenosis in the proximal segment .
The circumflex showed mild atherosclerotic .
The RCA occlusion was successfully dilated and sent using a 3.0 X 23 mm Duet with post stent dilatation up to 16 atmospheres .
Following intervention right heart catheterization was performed to rule out RV infarct .
The RA was 5 .
PA was 19/7 with a mean of 13 .
PCW was 11 .
Of note there was a clear A wave in the RV tracing , suggestive of RV infarct .
The next day the patient was quite confused and disoriented , which gradually disappeared .
