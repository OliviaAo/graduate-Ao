HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 5 year old male with multiple anomalies transferred from <HOSPITAL>Capa An- Medical Center</HOSPITAL> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> on <DATE>07/20</DATE> for management of airway obstruction secondary to tracheal stenosis / history of difficult intubations .
The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and intubations .
On <DATE>08/10/90</DATE> the patient had surgery to remove granulomas in the trachea after traumatic intubation for seizures .
The patient first presented with stridor and respiratory distress on <DATE>02/92</DATE> .
A bronchoscopy at that time showed a 50% tracheal stenosis .
Since then the patient has had intermittent episodes of stridor with agitation with upper respiratory tract infections .
On <DATE>07/19/92</DATE> the patient awoke with significant stridor , respiratory distress and the use of accessory muscles .
The patient was taken to the emergency room where he was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy .
On <DATE>07/19/92</DATE> direct laryngoscopy showed an 80% tracheal stenosis beginning just below the sternal notch involving the proximal 50th percent of the trachea .
They were unable to get to the distal part of the trachea .
The patient was a difficult intubation and it was finally performed by a thoracic surgeon using a 3.5 endotracheal tube .
The patient was then hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at <HOSPITAL>Asney Ewood Health Care</HOSPITAL> in <LOCATION>Losbroke Pringda Field Delp U</LOCATION> and maintained with Pavulon and Morphine .
Dr. <DOCTOR>Fields</DOCTOR> was consulted and the patient was transferred by <HOSPITAL>Ton Len N&apos;ss Community Hospital</HOSPITAL> to <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and management by Dr. <DOCTOR>Fields</DOCTOR> on <DATE>07/20</DATE> in the p.m.

Very mild .
The patient had a 3-0 Shiley trach placed approximately 1 cm below the vocal cords .
The trach extends approximately 1 cm below the area of stenosis .
Chest X-Rays shows clear lung fields bilaterally with the trach tube noted to be in good position .
I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative .
There is one Gram stain that showed some polys but otherwise they have been unremarkable .
There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia that could have precipitated this event and all X-Rays have been unremarkable .
The patient has a history of significant hyperinflation of the chest with an increased AP diameter which is mildly improved after the tracheostomy .

DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient will be transferred to <HOSPITAL>Ral Medical Center</HOSPITAL> in <LOCATION>Saintarv</LOCATION> on <DATE>7/25/92</DATE> by ambulance .
The patient has a 3-0 Shiley in place that is stitched to his neck and also has trach ties in places .
The trach appears to be quite stable and the patient is tolerating having his trach in quite nicely with a humidified mask .
The plans per ENT are that the patient &apos;s trach will not be changed for at least one months time .
Dr. <DOCTOR>Fields</DOCTOR> will contact Dr. <DOCTOR>Roosekote</DOCTOR> as to probable plans .
