HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room on <DATE>8-20-91</DATE> at which time a total knee repair was done to both the right and left knees .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to his room on postoperative day one .
The patient did , on , postoperative day one have a bout of grossly heme positive emesis .
He stated at this point that he did have a history of peptic ulcer disease and he did have a slow and continuous drop in his hematocrit until approximately postoperative day three .
The patient also had episodes of significant temperature spikes sometimes to 102.6 .
The patient was cultured multiple times , blood cultures , urine cultures and sputum cultures , all which were negative ( as well as chest x-ray ) .
The temperature spikes did continue but have reached to a degree no higher than 100 degrees Farenheit and occurred a significantly decreased number of times .
In terms of knee function , the patient has progressed very well and is ambulating approximately 12 feet on his own at this point .
In terms of followup care , I would suggest that the patient have a gastroenterologist consult upon completion of Rehab and for further workup of his grossly heme positive emesis , with possible guaiac positive stool searching for a source of a bleed .
The patient will be discharged on the following medications :
Labetalol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Enalapril 5 mg p.o. q.d. ; Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. q.d. ; Ferrous Gluconate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Carafate one gram p.o. q.i.d. ; Quinamm one p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. ; Percocet one to two p.o. q. 4 hours p.r.n.
The patient &apos;s condition on discharge is good .
The patient will be discharged to a rehabilitation center and will be followed up by Dr. <DOCTOR>Nu Jescraln</DOCTOR> in six weeks from discharge .
As stated above , it is suggested that the patient see his internist and possibly see a gastroenterologist for further workup in his grossly heme positive emesis as well as continued drop in hematocrit .
