HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and given a course of p.o. antibiotics including Levofloxacin and Flagyl with plans for a fourteen day course .
He initially received oxygen , two liters via nasal cannula , but had an oxygen saturation that remained at 92% on room air , so oxygen was discontinued .
His potassium was repleted from 2.6 up to 3.3 the day after admission and then up to 4.2 two days after admission .
The source for his hypokalemia was unknown .
He initially had watery diarrhea , thought secondary to soap ingestion which resolved two days after admission .
He was gently hydrated with 1/2 normal saline for two liters to keep up with his gastrointestinal losses .
He was continued on Risperdal which he takes for dementia .
He did have fevers the day after admission , but his fever curve gradually came down .
Because of the question of aspiration , a Speech and Swallow evaluation was obtained .
Before this evaluation , discussion was undertaken with the family who decided that even if the patient were aspirating that they would not want a feeding jejunal tube for feeding placed .
Speech evaluation felt that he may be aspirating occasionally when he coughs , however they did not recommend dietary modifications , but only that he be given soft , easily chewed items .
They also suggested that he be observed at meals to make sure that he paces himself to avoid aspirating .
They recommended follow-up evaluation if he develops further pneumonias or if he has increased coughing .
This can be arranged through his primary care physician or through the rehabilitation hospital if he is still an inpatient at rehabilitation .
The family also decided to make the patient DNR / DNI after he was admitted .
He will be transferred to rehabilitation to finish his course of antibiotics and to work on ambulation .
He will then return home with <HOSPITAL>HMC</HOSPITAL> services to live with his daughter-in-law and son .
