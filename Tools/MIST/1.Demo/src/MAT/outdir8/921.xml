Extremities :
Trace edema without cyanosis or clubbing .
His hematocrit at the time of admission was 20.5 , after having been 32 one week earlier .
ASSESSMENT :
The assessment was that he had a GI bleed .
He was transfused and then evaluated by GI .
Endoscopy showed multiple angio ectasias throughout the stomach .
He received multiple treatments for this over the succeeding weeks .
In addition , he was transfused .
His platelet count was maintained with platelet transfusion as necessary .
He was treated with Octreotide to try to slow down the bleeding .
Despite all these measures , his bleeding was never totally controlled .
He then had an angiogram with Gel foam to try to control his GI bleed .
Again , this was unsuccessful .
At that point he had a change in mental status and was no longer responsive .
Given this , the decision was made to make his care comfort measures only .
At this point , he was made comfort measures and expired comfortably .
The cause of death was a combination of GI bleeding felt to be ultimately related to his known metastatic pancreatic cancer .
