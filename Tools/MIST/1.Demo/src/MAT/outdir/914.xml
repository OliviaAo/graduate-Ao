ATTENDING :
<DOCTOR>LENNI EENAHILDE BREUTZOLN</DOCTOR> MD , PHD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
Perirectal abscess and myelodysplastic syndrome .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 67-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome subtype and refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation .
She was admitted for perirectal pain and fever .
HISTORY BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS :
History of MDS diagnosed in <DATE>June 2002</DATE> .
At that time was evidence of disease progression with 22% blast , which led to treatment with five azacitidine on compassionate use basis starting in <DATE>March 2003</DATE> .
On admission , she was status post three cycles of chemotherapy .
Her course have been complicated by perirectal pain and thrombosed hemorrhoids .
After her third cycle of chemotherapy , the patient noted worsening of her rectal pain along with fever and chills .
CT done as an outpatient showed inflammation and hemorrhoids but no obvious abscess .
The patient continues with rectal pain and fevers and eventually went to an outside hospital <HOSPITAL>Lichampm Kane Ancester Medical Center</HOSPITAL> where CT scan revealed a tiny area on the right consistent with hemorrhoids versus a tiny perirectal abscess as said initially , but the pain was secondary to hemorrhoids and anal fissure and local care was provided .
The patient &apos;s status worsened with continued elevated temperatures to 103 and increase in rectal pain .
The patient noted a yellowish drainage from the rectum .
The patient was then transferred on <DATE>7/14/03</DATE> to the <HOSPITAL>Gaanvantsir</HOSPITAL> due to her high-risk status .
Review of the CT scan from an outside hospital likely perirectal abscess given the CT was limited by not having IV ororal contrast .
The patient reports on admission having yellowish drainage from rectum occasionally pink , but no frank blood .
The stools were soft but formed .
Although , initially she has had constipation after starting chemotherapy .
She noted also nausea , decreased appetite , and decreased p.o. intake .
Also of note , on admission , she had increased urinary frequency but no difficulty urinating .
No weakness .
No abdominal pain .
Her temperature was elevated to 103 , but her blood pressure had been stable .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. From an infectious disease standpoint , she has a perirectal abscess .
Ceptaz and Flagyl were both started .
Blood cultures were done each morning for the first week with no growth during her hospitalization and her urinalysis and cultures were negative .
Surgery here saw the patient on <DATE>7/15/03</DATE> and they did an incision and drainage of her perirectal abscess and recommended daily sitz bath and also recommended increasing her p.o. water and fiber intake over the following two days , although the patient developed a rectal fistula for which surgery again had to be called .
They placed the drain and continued to follow the patient .
The patient continued to spike temperatures with perirectal pain after surgery and the Nasalide was added to her antibiotic regimen to cover for enterococcus and MRSA given the patient &apos;s resistence to ampicillin B and her history of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus .
The patient spiked only once after beginning with Nasalide and had been afebrile for six days before discharge .
About three days of discharge , her PICC site became inflamed , but the patient remained stable and afebrile .
Her PICC line was pulled and the patient was switched off oral antibiotics .
She remained stable and afebrile for two days before being discharged and after starting her p.o. antibiotics .
From pain perspective , we used OxyContin and oxycodone , which was titrated up during her hospitalization to maximize pain control and for ease of bathroom use .
2. From diet perspective FEN , she was hyponatremic on admission , which was secondary to her dehydration and resolved with hydration .
Her nutritional status is poor on admission with low albumin and an elevated INR .
She was given vitamin K and Nutrition was consulted .
With supplements and multivitamins and encouragement , the patient improved and had increased liquid and solid intake prior to discharge .
3. Cardiovascular wise , the patient has history of hypertension , although blood pressure was not elevated during her hospitalization and hydrochlorothiazide she had on admission was discontinued .
4. Rheumatalogically , the patient has history of rheumatoid arthritis .
She was on 1 mg of prednisone every other day , which was tapered and discontinued .

The patient will follow up with her oncologist for her final results and for further treatment .
6. From genitourinary perspective , the patient complained of difficulty urinating .
She was started on Ditropan and that was suggested to optimize relief of symptoms .
On discharge , the patient had fewer complaints of difficulty starting her urine and upon discharge is to follow up with her PCP for further treatment .
