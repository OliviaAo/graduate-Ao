HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 35-year-old female had a history of bilateral severe hearing loss since the age of four , which worsened several years ago .
This was evaluated by Dr. <DOCTOR>Rybam Selcjescpint</DOCTOR> beginning in the early 1990s. The diagnosis of atypical Meniere &apos;s disease was made .
A CT scan without contrast in 1991 was reported to be normal .
She reported there was still some sound perception in the left ear , although it was not useful hearing .
In the right ear , she used a hearing aid , which helped her .
On <DATE>5/16/97</DATE> , she awakened with tingling and numbness involving first her left arm , then the leg , then the face , associated with mild headache and nausea .
The numbness persisted .
No focal objective neurological deficit was found .
Magnetic resonance imaging showed findings consistent with an acoustic neuroma in the left cerebellar pontine angle extending approximately 3 centimeters into the posterior fossa .
There was a cystic component on the medial superior aspect of the tumor .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :

The facial nerve was markedly involved with the tumor .
Only a portion of the fibers could be kept intact , and the rest were reapproximated .

The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. <DOCTOR>Yertrey Sumchirdkaysmavveindreps</DOCTOR> of the Ocular Plastic Service , and on <DATE>6/19/97</DATE> , a gold weight was placed in the left upper eyelid .
