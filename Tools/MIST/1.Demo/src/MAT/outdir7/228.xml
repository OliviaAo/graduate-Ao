HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :

She came in for an EP study and radiofrequency ablation .
Her baseline EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm , normal EKG with no evidence of pre-excitation .
EP study revealed normal baseline intervals , no evidence of accessory pathway , midline decremental AV and VA conduction .
She had a short RP tachycardia with an AA predicting HH with high-low activation consistent with AT .
She had a CARTO MAP in normal sinus rhythm and SVT which revealed that the tachycardia rose from the lateral portion of the right atrium medially inferior to the sinus node and posterior to the pathway to the phrenic nerve .
Applications of RF energy inferior to the sinus node and posterior to the phrenic nerve with of the SVT resulted in termination of tachycardia and non-inducibility , thereafter .
