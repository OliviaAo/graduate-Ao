Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
The patient comes in today for right upper outer quadrant nodularity .
On physical examination , she has no significant axillary or cervical lymphadenopathy .
She has no distinct masses in either of her breasts .
She has some thickening in the upper outer quadrant of her right breast , which the patient indicates is stable and has been there for stable years .
I am unable to detect any distinctly abnormal findings on physical examination .
However , in light of the presence of some nodularity and her level of concern , I will plan to see her again in one year when she is scheduled for her followup mammogram .
