BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
HPI :
Pt is a 67 year old R handed female with hx of HTN who awoke on <DATE>01/02</DATE> with R sided weakness .
Per her daughter , who lives with her , 6 am she was awake in bed not complaining of weakness .
However , at that time she did not get out of bed .
At 8:30 am she awoke out of bed and noticed that her arm and leg felt &quot; heavy &quot; and she was unable to walk without dragging her R leg .
Denied numbness or tingling , no change in mental status .
She was brought to ED for further evaluation .

PE ON ADMISSION :
BP 216/92 , HR 78 , afebrile ; General exam was notable for chronic skin changes on LE .
NEURO EXAM :
Mental status was intact .
Cranial nerves notable for slight R facial weakness , otherwise intact .
Motor exam - full strength on left ; Right sided arm and leg weakness 3-4/5 , greater distally than proximally .
Sensation intact .
The right toe was upgoing , the left down .
She was able to stand only with support .
Labs on admission :
Glu 107 , BUN 10 , Cr 0.8 , Na 140 , K 3.5 , LFTs WNL , troponin less than assay ; WBC 5.6 , HCT 41.8 , PLT 240 , coags
WNL IMAGING :
Head
CT :
no evidence infarction
Head / Neck CTA :
No evidence of abnormality except for a congenitally small vertebrobasilar system
MRI Brain :
Infarction within the left lenticular nucleus extending superiorly to the left corona radiata ; small vessel disease
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Pt was admitted to the neurology service for work-up .
As she had been taking ASA prior to admission , Aggrenox was started for secondary prevention .
Homocystine was high at 12 , therefore vitamins B6 , B12 and folate were started ; Cholesterol was high at 259 with an LDL of 192 - a statin was initiated .
Blood pressures were initially allowed to run in the 150s-160s , however at the time of discharge more aggressive BP management is advised , and in addition to her beta-blocker , an ACE-inhibitor was started .
A TTE preliminary read shows an EF of 60% with mild AI , trace MR , trace TR , LVH ; a bubble study was negative .
A 24-hour Holter is pending ; the Pt was in NSR on EKGs , and was ruled-out for MI by cardiac enzymes .
Pt was seen by PT and OT who have recommended acute rehabilitation .
Clinically , the Pt improved during the hospital course , with residual mild R nasolabial fold flattening , 4+/5 strength proximally of the right arm and leg ; she is slightly weaker distally with 3/5 of the interosseous muscles on the right .
IMPRESSION :
This is a 67 y / o woman with poorly controlled HTN , hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism , who presented with a lacunar stroke , most likely due to HTN .
Given her fairly young age , investigation of cardioembolic sources was pursued and not found by TTE , though a Holter report is still pending .
Secondary prevention will include improved BP treatment ( added ACE ) , cholesterol treatment ( added statin ) , treatment of high homocystine with B vitamins , and a switch from ASA to Aggrenox .
She is being discharged to rehab and will F / U in the neurology clinic in 4-6 weeks .
