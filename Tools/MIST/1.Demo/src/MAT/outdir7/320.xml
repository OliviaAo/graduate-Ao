HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
<PATIENT>Mayta Neek</PATIENT> is a 69-year-old patient of Dr. <DOCTOR>Queszucenove Tadl</DOCTOR> at <HOSPITAL>Cochusetts Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
He presents with increasing chest pain and shortness of breath .
He has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries .
His first coronary bypass surgery was on <DATE>5/7/1985</DATE> by Dr. <DOCTOR>Riez</DOCTOR> .
He had LIMA to the LAD and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery .
He presented with angina and had an occluded LAD and severe circumflex and right coronary disease .
He had normal left ventricular function .
He did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in <DATE>March of 2000</DATE> showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded .
The left main was normal .
The LAD was also occluded .
The circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches .
The LIMA to the LAD was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the LAD .
The snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .
For this reason , he had a second bypass operation on <DATE>5/5/2000</DATE> by Dr. <DOCTOR>Riez</DOCTOR> .
He had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .
He had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the LAD bypassing the mid lesion .
The LIMA was left from the first surgery .
He did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .
He had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on <DATE>8/28/2001</DATE> showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm S660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .
He did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on <DATE>1/17/2005</DATE> showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling .
He therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc .
He also has had cataract repairs .
FAMILY HISTORY :
He has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
His social history is that he lives in <LOCATION>Lotyvall 1 , Quera , Minnesota</LOCATION> with his wife <PATIENT>Second</PATIENT> .
He has four children .
He is present in a <LOCATION>Capefrecam Luhthousy</LOCATION> .
He does not drink and does not smoke .
ALLERGIES :
He is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds .
His blood pressure is 130/75 .
His pulse is 50 and regular .
His neck veins are not distended .
His head and neck exam is normal .
His lungs are clear .
His cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops .
His abdomen is benign .
His peripheral pulses are intact .
His neurologic exam was nonfocal .
He is fully oriented .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block .
Hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory .
There , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the RV marginal and the right-sided PDA was patent .
The LAD was occluded and the LIMA to the proximal LAD was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the LAD and that was also patent .
The vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .
The culprit territory was the distal left-sided PDA coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis .
This was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion .
It was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically .
Left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function .
He tolerated the procedure well .
He was monitored for the day .
He ambulated without difficulty .
He was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at <HOSPITAL>Sko Gerb Timp Valley Health</HOSPITAL> and at <HOSPITAL>Middso Memorial Hospital</HOSPITAL> &apos;s .
He will remain on beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , statins , aspirin and Plavix indefinitely .
