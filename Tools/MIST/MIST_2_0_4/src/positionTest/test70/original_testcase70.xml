The circumflex had a long 30% stenosis proximally and an 80% stenosis at the origin of the second major marginal artery .
The left ventricular angiogram showed akinesis of the posterobasal walls , severe hypokinesis of the diaphragmatic wall and trace mitral regurgitation .
The patient was maintained on heparin anticoagulation .
An exercise tolerance test with Thallium was to be performed in order to assess myocardial viability in the infarct zone .
The right coronary artery lesion was complex and there was severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal 1 .
The patient had no further angina .
The thallium images showed a large region of persistently reduced blood flow involving the apex and inferoposterior segments of the left ventricular wall .
This was consistent with scar .
There was no definite perfusion abnormality in the circumflex zone .

1. Gait ataxia .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES :
Cimetidine 400 mg po b.i.d. ; aspirin 80 mg po q.d. ; Ventolin two puffs q.i.d. ;
Permanent .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75-year-old right handed man with a past history of migraine , peripheral neuropathy , gait ataxia , and microvascular leukomalacia on magnetic resonance imaging study , was admitted because of an abrupt worsening of walking .
A peripheral neuropathy was first diagnosed in 1989 , cause undetermined .
Increased imbalance occurred in 1991 , at which time he was unable to walk tandem and swayed on the Romberg test .
Brain magnetic resonance imaging study showed atrophy and microvascular leukomalacia .
He had an episode of headache , flashing light , confusion and possible loss of consciousness in <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> , 1993 , at which time an magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain was unchanged and MRA was negative .
Memory , gait and occasional urinary incontinence worsened after that time .
The present admission was prompted by an episode of inability to walk at all for the past two or three days .
A computerized tomography scan done in the emergency room showed enlarged ventricles , suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus .
Blood pressure 154/90 .
He was alert and fully oriented , but had some trouble remembering current events and made one error in the Tom and Bill story after ten minutes .
There was no aphasia .
Gait was quite ataxic , with short steps , requiring support , but no freezing in place .
He swayed backward on the Romberg test .
Upward gaze was decreased .
Cranial nerves otherwise normal .
Slight left iliopsoas weakness .
Tendon reflex is absent .
Plantars withal , possibly bilaterally extensor .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Routine laboratory studies were negative .
A therapeutic lumbar puncture was planned on the day after emergency admission , but his gait was noted to be considerably improved at that time , and the lumbar puncture was postponed until <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 5</PHI> , at which time 40 cc were removed .
There was slight further improvement of gait , mainly less unsteadiness , but no change in speed .
The gait was essentially what it had been before the episode of worsening prior to admission , moderate ataxia , slight flexed posture , very slight shuffling .
It was decided to continue to follow Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fyfeshuff</PHI> on an outpatient basis , with a follow up appointment in one month .
If there is significant deterioration of gait , shunt treatment will be reconsidered .

Report Status :
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
2. Aortic stenosis .
The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; .
She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea .
The pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement .
Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history .
Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-13</PHI>-92 , done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Otte A , New Jersey</PHI> and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 .
She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day .
On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 .
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Extremi-ties :
There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable .
LAB / X-RAY DATA :
Labs on admission :
Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 .
EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-01</PHI>-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy .
This was performed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Medicine</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Room</PHI> .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .
She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-04</PHI>-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .
There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-9</PHI>-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia .
She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-11</PHI>-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness .
She was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid .
She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .
She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement .
DISPOSITION :
She is transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Rockdempbanri Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-28</PHI>-92 to continue her rehabilitation .
Discharge medications :
Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Timoptic solution 0.5% OS b.i.d. ; Coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and Haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion .
Upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 73 year old white female with a history of pancreatic cancer treated with 5-FU and a vague history of chest pain , admitted with EKG changes of unclear duration , consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction .
She underwent a Whipple procedure and a cholecystectomy .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> of 1989 , she was begun on 5-FU for five days of treatment followed by three weeks of no treatment .
Since then , she has had occasional lower sternal chest pain when lying on her side , reproducible by palpation .
Two weeks prior to admission , she had a presyncopal episode but did not lose consciousness .
There were no other symptoms .
One day prior to admission , she was seen at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dagreat Health</PHI> for 5-FU , her third cycle .
She complained of chest pain and back pain , and an EKG was obtained which showed new Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , and T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , consistent with an anterior septal myocardial infarction .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Include smoking and increased cholesterol .
There is no diabetes , hypertension , or family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes (1) pancreatic cancer , status post a Whipple procedure , on 5-FU .
(2) Status post a cholecystectomy , appendectomy , and hysterectomy .
(3) Fibrocystic breast disease .
She has no known drug allergies .
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is an elderly white female in no apparent distress with a temperature of 97.6 , blood pressure 122/70 , heart rate of 72 , and a respiratory rate of 20 .
Her physical examination is notable for an essentially entirely normal physical examination .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , includes a white blood cell count of 5.6 , hematocrit 37.4 , platelets 312 .
Her electrolytes were within normal limits .
The urinalysis showed 5-10 white blood cells .
There were two red blood cells .
The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 75 , axis -30 degrees , Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , new in comparison to <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 1985 .
The patient was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dagreat Health</PHI> Service where she ruled out for a myocardial infarction by CK &apos;s and LDH &apos;s .
An echocardiogram was done which showed apical septal akinesis , but with well preserved systolic function .
Just prior to discharge , she underwent an exercise tolerance test with a modified Bruce protocol where she went seven minutes and seventeen seconds , and stopped secondary to fatigue .
She did not have any chest pain or EKG changes , however , hermaximal heart rate was 71 , and her blood pressure was 110/60 .
It was felt by the cardiologist on the case that this was more exercise than she usually did at home , and she was comfortable with the current medical regimen .
PROBLEM # 2 :
PANCREATIC CANCER .
The patient will be continued on her 5-FU as an outpatient , to be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
Lumbosacral spines done during the admission did not show any change from x-rays done previously .
PROBLEM # 3 :
HISTORY OF DIZZINESS .
The patient complained of some dizziness and had a presyncopal episode prior to admission , however , the patient felt that her dizziness was unchanged from the dizziness that she had for several years .
PROBLEM # 4 :
The patient had an anemia on admission .
She had normal iron and TIBC .
Reticulocyte count is pending at the time of this dictation .
I suspect that this is anemia of chronic disease , but could not rule out gastrointestinal blood loss , although she remained guaiac negative .
PROBLEM # 5 :
The patient 8-10 white blood cells in the urine on admission , and the urine culture was no growth so far at the time of discharge .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is being discharged in stable condition , and is to be followed up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
She should arrange to be followed up by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 63 year old white male with a family history of myocardial infarction and narcotic abuse with a large cell Pancoasttumor in cardiogenic shock after an anterior wall myocardial infarction .
He did not have any arrest .
Nine days prior to admission , a CT and biopsy showed a large cell cancer .
Four days prior to admission , a bone scan showed right lateral rib positive .
Two days prior to admission to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Camweissallcoa Medical Center</PHI> , he developed 3/6 substernal chest pain which lasted 20-30 minutes .
He had shortness of breath .
He had nausea and diaphoresis .
He went to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ryosentlourdes Hospital</PHI> , where he ruled in with EKGs and CPKs .
He had a new right bundle and marked ST changes .
PAST HISTORY :
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with &quot; marginal PFTs &quot; ; alcohol abuse ; skin graft after a parachute failed to open .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
ALLERGIES :
Unclear .
The neck was supple ; carotids were without bruits .
The chest exam revealed crackles .
The cardiac exam revealed tachycardia and very distant sounds .
The abdominal exam revealed bowel sounds present .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Potassium 3.3 ; creatinine 1.5 ; hematocrit 38.0 ; white count 65,000 ; platelets 445,000 .
A Swan showed a PA of 40/21 , a wedge of 17 , cardiac output 3.8 and index 2.3 .
He was on 2 mcg of dopamine .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the ICU and was fully monitored with an A-line and Swan .
He was taken to cardiac cath where he was found to have a total occlusion of his LAD after his first diagonal .
His circumflex had a 60% obstruction prior to the obtuse marginal branch with a 60% stenosis of the obtuse marginal branch .
The obtuse marginal second branch was subtotally occluded .
The RCA had an 80% stenosis in its mid portion and 40% distal obstruction .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
It was considered that too much time had elapsed since his infarction and nothing was to be gained by revascularizing this infarct zone .
He did eventually then go to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/14</PHI>/90 , at which time he had an emergency CABG times three with asaphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and one onto the PDA .
The left internal mammary artery went onto the LAD .
He was transferred to the CICU postop , where he had his balloon removed after being stabilized .
He was extubated without complications and had his chest tubes removed in a standard fashion .
He was diuresed down to his preop weight .
He then was up ambulating with physical therapy but very slowly , and he was quite weak .
Hematology was asked to consult with the patient .
He was felt to have a leukomoid reaction with his white count postop of around 90,000 .
This is currently around 30,000 to 40,000 .
Radiation therapy was consulted , and it was felt that radiation therapy may be the most immediate treatment of the tumor .
He had a bone scan which showed positive uptake in the right first rib but was otherwise negative .
A head CT was negative .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged home in stable condition with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CMC</PHI> and physical therapy .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. daily ; Ecotrin one tab p.o. daily ; captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Percocet 1-2 tabs p.o. q4-6h p.r.n. pain .

Temperature of 97 degrees with a rate of 90 in atrial fibrillation and blood pressure 110/82 .
The patient was pain free and resting comfortably .
His neck showed a left-sided carotid which was 2+ without bruit , and a right-sided carotid which was 1+ without bruit .
Heart examination showed a PMI , which was diffuse and inferiorly displaced with an auricular rhythm with an S1 and S2 , II/VI systolic ejection murmur , no rub or gallop was noted .
Pulses :
2+ femoral without bruit , 1+ dorsalis pedis on the left , trace dorsalis pedis on the right and trace posterior tibial bilaterally .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN and creatinine of 29/1.4 , glucose 142 , hematocrit was 30.9 .
After intubation his pH was 7.32 with a p02 208 , and 02 saturation 99.7% , pC02 28 , total C02 15 .
Repeat ABG done later had a pH of 7.38 p02 of 247 , O2 saturation of 99.9% , pC02 22 , total C02 of 14 .
Magnesium 2.1 initially and during the code was 1.8 , cholesterol 144 , triglyceride 121 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the unit and experienced some nausea and vomiting with minimal EKG changes .
He became tachycardic to the rate of 110 , with a blood pressure of 128 to 130 .
His heart rate went down to 60 .
At this time , he was also given 25 mg po of Lopressor .
Later , within an half hour the blood pressure dipped into the 70s systolic , and IV fluid was started .
He was given Compazine PR and was started on Dopamine and then Dobutamine was added when that did not appear sufficient to increase his blood pressure above 80 .
He had a good urinary output .
The patient complained of pain between his shoulder blades and at this time IV fluid was increased , so was the Dopamine and Dobutamine .
Atropine X 2 amps were given and the heart rate was in the 60s with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 to 90 range by Doppler .
Oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .
The patient was intubated and prior to intubation his rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .
Surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump .
Central access was gained and a chest x-ray was done which showed no pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as NG tube .
He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .
Atropine one amp was given .
At this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .
There was a question of fleeting T waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead EKG .
At this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .
At this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .
The rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.
The patient was without respirations or blood pressure .
The family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .
Autopsy was requested , however , the patient &apos;s family will not give us their decision until tomorrow morning .

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE .
Unsigned
Report Status :

ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">3/25</PHI>/93
congestive heart failure .
aortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency .
cardiac catheterization - <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Lasix 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
He had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .
He also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .
Despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .
The carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .
There was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .
The right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .
There was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .
His chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .
The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , 1992 .
The left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .
The aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .
There was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .
The left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .
There was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .
A Persantine Thallium scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .
LABORATORY DATA :
This was of uncertain significance .
The hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .
Over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .
Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .
Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 .
At the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .
Left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .
There was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .
The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .
The aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .
A dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .
The posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .
The saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .
The saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .
These findings were reviewed with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Patella</PHI> and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> &apos;s management .
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .
It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .
He seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .
He is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .

ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">07-15</PHI>-92
<PHI TYPE="DATE">08-23</PHI>-92
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Intracerebral hemorrhage .
Status post resection of a cerebellar medulloblastoma .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 50 year old , right handed , white male with a history of resection of left cerebellar medulloblastoma , resected six years ago and status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy , with a six month history of 30 pound weight loss , who was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> with a left basilar ganglion hemorrhage .
At baseline , he had lived with his guardians , <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Pandeprob</PHI> , he was &quot; slow &quot; , walked with a very ataxic gait , did not talk much and spends most of his time watching TV and smoking .
He had had several months of increased difficulty swallowing and slurred speech .
He had been evaluated by his local medical doctor for his weight loss .
He was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> after being found in the bathroom , on the floor at 8 a.m. , unresponsive .
Cerebellar brain carcinoma , status post surgery , chemotherapy and radiation therapy six to seven years ago .
He had not had any recurrence .
He had history of alcohol abuse in the past .
There was no cardiac disease , hypertension or diabetes mellitus .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His oropharynx was clear .
His skin was clear .
The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 , regular rate and rhythm , no murmur , rub or gallop .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly .
Pulses were 2+ throughout .
The rectal tone was normal with no enlarged prostate , and he was heme positive .
Neurologically , he opened his eyes with sternal rub , but not verbalization .
He did not have verbal communication and he did not follow verbal commands .
His pupils were asymmetric , 6 mm. to 4 mm. on the left , right pupil was 5 mm. reacting to 3 mm.
There was no retinopathy .
He had a gag and good palpate movement .
He lifted his left leg off the bed , but no against resistance .
His deep tendon reflexes were noted for symmetric reflexes with upper extremities being 2 and patella 3 .
He had clonus bilaterally with up going toe on the right , but not the left .
LABORATORY DATA :
There was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .
On admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was a large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .
Once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .
An magnetic resonance imaging study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/17</PHI>/92 showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest I minus on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/27</PHI>/92 did not show the mass initially noted .
A testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for mass .
There was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .
An abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non-enhancing .
The GI Service was consulted on this mass and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .
Initially , the patient remained drowsy until Decadron was added to his medical regimen .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the right side and ability to walk with assistance .
He was started on Dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .
This seemed to help him remarkably with increased activity .
He still spends a lot of time in bed , although easily arousable .
He needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .
Speech was nonfluent with occasional single words .
He followed all commands readily .
There was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .
He had limited vertical up gaze .
He still had a significant right central facial droop .
His gag was intact with palatal movements .
Thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .
He had approximately 4+ to 5/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities .
His left side was full .
He had marked dysmetria bilaterally , but left greater than right to finger to nose and his gait was very ataxic .
His deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the right with 3 right brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and patella .
He had right clonus , which was sustained .
A head computerized tomography scan was repeated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/08</PHI>/92 which revealed some resolution of blood .
At that time , there was no evidence of a mass behind the hematoma .
It was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .
Thus , he should return to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> to have a repeat head computerized tomography scan in one month to further evaluate a possible mass lesion behind the hematoma .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Incisional biopsy , left hip ; bipolar hemiarthroplasty insertion .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Nertland</PHI> is a 51 year old , otherwise healthy white female who presented to her local doctor with left hip pain and was found on x-ray to have a lytic lesion in the left femoral neck .
A bone scan was done and no other lesions were noted .
A chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm right middle lobe lung lesion .
A chest CT confirmed the lesion in the right middle lobe as well as multipletiny granulomata which were benign-appearing .
She was admitted for incisional biopsy and resection of her femoral lesion , a same-day admit .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Significant for total abdominal hysterectomy , 1971 ; appendectomy , 1971 ; D and C .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Premarin .
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The chest CT revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the right middle lobe , consistent with neoplastic disease .
She underwent an open biopsy and bipolar hemiarthroplasty on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/27</PHI> without complication .
The frozen section revealed adenocarcinoma with characteristics most likely attributed to lung rather than the GI tract for primary site , based on the frozen section .
Final pathology was pending at the time of discharge .
She did well and progressed with physical therapy and was able to do stairs with crutches , ambulating with a walker by postoperative day # 5 .
She was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Breunspeelm</PHI> from Oncology , who felt that most likely it was metastatic lung cancer to the bone ; however , breast cancer remains a possibility .
He also noted that if it is metastatic breast cancer it is a more treatable condition .
He also recommended considering radiotherapy to the lung lesion .
He also recommended that she be switched from Premarin to tamoxifen .
All chemotherapy options will be discussed at sarcoma conference , as will all of the above .
The plan is for her to betreated at home by her local doctors .
She was sent home with a raised toilet seat and a transfer tub bench .
Coumadin for six weeks after surgery , 2 mg q.d.
DISPOSITION :
Her staples can be taken out in 2-3 weeks after the surgery by her local doctor .
She was discharged home .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Ascending aortic dissection , cutaneous drug eruption , diarrhea , congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , anuric renal failure , stroke , postoperative bleeding , mitral regurgitation , history of rheumatic fever .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/93 - mitral valve replacement and replacement of ascending aorta .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">06/29</PHI>/93 - white cell scan ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/03</PHI>/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/05</PHI>/93 - brain magnetic resonance imaging study ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/05</PHI>/93 - abdominal computerized tomography scan ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07-08</PHI>-93 - cardiac ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/07</PHI>/93 - pelvic ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/09</PHI>/93 - barium enema ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/14</PHI>/93 - cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/93 - reopening of sternum ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/22</PHI>/93 - mediastinal exploration .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .
She was in her usual state of health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/15</PHI>/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .
There were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .
Because of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">O Center</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Sondibrid Ey</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/20</PHI> , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
Her antibiotics were appropriately changed .
At the family &apos;s request , the patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation .
Further evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
She was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .
The patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .
She was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .
In addition , she was evaluated by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Sileyer Medical Center</PHI> and there was no evidence of active dental infection .
Her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .
A rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/13</PHI> , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .
After considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .
Also , no source for sepsis had been found .
Accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/93 .
Her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .
It was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .
Her valve was replaced with a St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
She remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .
After consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/26</PHI>/93 at 11:10 a.m.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CML .
OTHER DIAGNOSES :
1. STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .
2. INTRAPARENCHYMAL BLEED .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Larsen</PHI> was a 50-year-old salesman who in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/26</PHI> was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .
He was found to have CML .
He was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/07</PHI>/00 for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/24</PHI>/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/26</PHI>/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
Although the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/01</PHI>/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 79 year old female whose cardiac risk factors include hyperlipidemia , hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , positive family history .
She had a minimally invasive single vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1998 , consisting of a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI> , she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> with a myocardial infarction , complicated by cardiogenic shock .
She had cardiac catheretization at that time , which revealed patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , a dominant left circumflex artery , with an 80% stenosis and a patent right coronary artery .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/30</PHI>/02 she presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> again , with acute onset of shortness of breath while at rest , without other associated symptoms .
She was diuresed and underwent cardiac catheterization , reported as a 90% right coronary artery stenosis , 100% native left anterior descending , patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , sclerotiic distal LAD , 80% mid left circumflex stenosis ; posterior descending artery of 40% and 80% sequentially .
Echocardiogram at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with anteroapical aneurysm , EF of 20% , mild left atrial dilatation , aorticsclerosis and mild pulmonary hypertension .
BLOOD PRESSURE 110/60 , heart rate 60 , irregular .
O2 hemostasis of 97% , neurological awake , alert and oriented x three but poor short term memory and mild confusion .
Neck was soft and supple .
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with mildly diminished breath sounds at the bases .
S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen soft , with positive bowel sounds .
No bruits audible .
LAB DATA RADIOLOGY :
Na 136 , K 4.5 , Cl 97 , CO2 26.7 .
BUN 29 , creat 1.7 .
Digoxin 1.0 , WBC 8.5 , hematocrit 34.5 , hemoglobin 11.2 , platelets 289 .
PT 13.7 / PTT 26.3 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/8</PHI>/02 she underwent a Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex in stent restenosis with a 3.0 x 10.0 cutting balloon and then underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the distal left circumflex lesion , followed by deployment of the 2.0 x 13.0 mm Pixel stent .
Following post deployment inflation , the vessel was at full volume without clot or dissection , and TIMI 3 flow .
She was maintained on Integrilin for 12 hours ; her sheaths were removed without difficulty .
After sheath removal , she was started on Fragmin in anticipation of maintaining anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation .
She felt right leg weakness during the procedure , but experienced a great deal of difficulty the following morning , ambulating to the bathroom due to this weakness , which resolved after 2-3 hours .
MRI was recommended , and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/12</PHI> she underwent an MRI which revealed an acute infarct in the left posterior corona radiata and narrowing at the P2 segment of the right PCA .
After her right lower extremity weakness resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .
Throughout the hospitalization she remained fatigued and lethargic , resisting mobilization .
She was seen in consultation by the Renal service who followed along closely .
Eventually she had renal MRA which was reported as showing severe right renal artery stenosis .
Following the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .
She underwent abdominal CT which was negative for retroperitoneal bleed .
She was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .
She was seen in consultation by PT , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .
She was found to have a 4 x normal risk of falling , which was felt to be significant .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
She is ready for discharge to a nursing facility for further strength training .

She has had these problems for approximately 10 years , and is cared for by a family member .
W / U for Huntington &apos;s , ceruloplasmin , TSH , etc have all been negative in the past .
Now presents with report of sub-acute worsening of confusion .
Patient was admitted to neurology service .
She had a gradual imporvement of her confusion back towards baseline during the hospital stay .
Infact , this medication was found to cause a significant improvement in her choreoathetotic perioral and arm movements .
She still has significant myoclonic component in her arms especially with volition , but this med will certainly be continued .
While essentially what we ARE hoping for in this use of the med is extra-pyramidal side effects , she should be monitored for any excessive or debilitating parkinsonian symptoms such as excessive rigidity .

UNIT NUMBER :
<PHI TYPE="ID">961-90-81</PHI>
<PHI TYPE="DATE">08/15</PHI>/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
She was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Aper Hospital</PHI> for change in mental status on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/19</PHI>/2002 .
Initial work up was unrevealing .
She was discharged to rehabilitation and developed disorientation , confusion , incoordination , and apparent paranoia .
She was diagnosis with a urinary tract infection and perineal inflammation and was transferred to the hospital and treated with IV Tequin for urinary tract infection .
There was a reported examination of her peritoneal fluid when fluid was being drawn for culture .
A catheter was subsequently placed for treatment of __________ for three days of ceftazidime .
Herperitoneal fluid cultures have all been negative and showed only 3 polys .
There was a question of 3 x 4 collection around the peritoneal catheter that was investigated with an I+ abdominal CT scan that was not conclusive .
She was switched , however , to hemodialysis from peritoneal dialysis .
Alumbar puncture of on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/31</PHI>/2002 was significant for an opening pressure reported as 12 cm of water .
Only 1 white blood cell was detected , and the fluid was culture and gram stain negative .
An electroencephalogram showed nonspecific , left greater than right slowing , without epileptiform spikes .
A Speech and Swallow evaluation initially deemed her an aspiration risk , and she was taken of PO &apos;s .
Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was found to be 48 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for end-stage renal disease secondary to chronic urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis with vesicoureteral reflux .
Peritoneal dialysis x ten years , resulting from that .
And status post right nephrectomy , status post cholecystectomy , ____________thyroidectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">BRI HEALTH</PHI> FROM <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">APER HOSPITAL</PHI> :
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Not available at the time .
She denies the use of tobacco or ethanol .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile at 98.7 , blood pressure 128/64 , heart rate 96 , respiratory rate 22 , 02 s 96% on room air .
In general , she was well appearing in no apparent distress .
The pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation .
The oropharynx was moist .
The chest was clear bilaterally .
The heart had a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no erythema around the catheter site .
There was only mild suprapubic fullness that was not tender .
There was no peripheral edema .
On neurologic examination , the patient followed only simple commands .
She moved all extremities .
She had decreased strength bilaterally .
She missed her nose with both hands when asked to touch her nose .
The toes were downgoing on the left .
She appeared to understand questions , but then could not come up with the answers , or where she was , and she could not give her name , but did respond when her name was used .
On admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 .
Her liver function tests were all within normal limits .
Her coagulation factors showed a PT of 13.2 , INR 1.2 , PTT 23.2 .
Her white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 .
The hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 .
The differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes .
Abdominal CT scan from the outside hospital showed no abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts .
The electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .
Head CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/30</PHI>/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe .
As noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative Clostridium difficile , a weakly positive D-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient &apos;s presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer &apos;s of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .
In addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .
For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .
For her FEN , the patient was able to take PO &apos;s and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take PO &apos;s with one to one supervision .
From an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/10</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/12</PHI>/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .
Excellent suggestions from Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Pa</PHI> of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient &apos;s weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .
The patient &apos;s mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/10</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/12</PHI> and was markedly improved on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/13</PHI>/2002 , compared with the day of admission .
However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .
The nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .
CA-125 levels were within normal limits .
We entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .
We will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .
Pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Termarimed</PHI> pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .

PROBLEMS :
Include hypertension .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 57-year-old female status post ERT with recurrence of a pelvic mass and resection at an outside hospital in <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/22</PHI> .
Per the patient , the mass was benign .
The patient was started on Lupron on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/03 , but pain was not affected .
She was put on Vicodin ES and Ultram with minimal relief .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/16</PHI>/03 , the patient &apos;s pain increased and she presented to an outside hospital with nausea and vomiting and an inability to tolerate p.o. intake .
The left lower quadrant pain in the groin radiated to the left knee .
No fevers or chills , no vaginal discharge or bleeding .
Potassium at the outside hospital was 3.1 .
Hematocrit was 28.7 .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">NVH</PHI> after receiving intravenous fluid with potassium , Demerol for pain control and clindamycin , Valium and droperidol .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypothyroidism , arthritis , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , anemia and asthma .
A TAH-BSO in 1980 and an exploratory laparotomy with resection of a pelvic mass in <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/22</PHI> .
2. Ultram .
3. Verapamil 240 mg b.i.d.
4. Synthroid 100 mcg q.d.
6. Arthrotec 0.2 mg b.i.d.
9. Ambien 10 mg q.h.s.
10. Trazadone 150 mg q.h.s.
Her allergies are penicillin , which cause throat edema .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
No tobacco , alcohol or drug use .
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">NVH</PHI> and started on vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl .
Cultures were taken .
Blood cultures done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/17</PHI>/03 grew C. perfringens .
Other blood culture was negative .
The patient was taken to the operating room for bilateral stent placement , resection of the pelvic mass , lysis of adhesions , left ureterolysis , rectosigmoid resection , SBR , removal of a vaginal tumor , omentectomy complicated by an enterotomy and was admitted to the ICU postoperatively on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/21</PHI>/03 .
Postoperative course by systems is as follows :
1. Neuro :
The patient was anxious with depression poorly controlled until <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/14</PHI>/03 .
2. Cardiovascular :
After a Cardiology consulton <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/13</PHI>/03 , the patient was started on metoprolol 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg q.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d. .
Hydralazine was stopped .
Blood pressure stayed high with an SBP in the 170s , so amlodipine 10 mg q.d. was added and that blood pressure was still elevated .
Once the patient was extubated , after the third surgery , the patient could not be weaned off 2 liters of nasal cannula and was to ______ to 20 breaths per minute despite nebulizer treatment .
The patient was restarted on Advair and by <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/15</PHI>/03 , was weaned to room air likely an effective Advair and control of anxiety and psychiatric issues .
4. GI :
A chest x-ray revealed increased free air under the diaphragm .
A CT revealed a large amount of free air .
The patient was taken to the OR on postop day 5 for emergent exploratory laparotomy that disclosed a small bowel enterotomy with 2 liters of bilious fluid within the peritoneum .
Intraoperatively , the patient suffered hypotension with induction and respiratory insufficiency .
The patient was transferred to the ICU intubated with stable .
The patient was kept NPO with an NG tube until postop day 14 and_____ started on clear sips with TPN for nutritional supplementation .
The patient , at the time of transfer , was tolerating clears with low stoma output , likely to tolerate slow advancement .
The patient still had a PICC line at the time , although TPN was being held and calorie counts were done to evaluate the benefit of p.o. nutrition .
5. GU :
No issues .
The patient generally had good urine output .
Presumably , should follow up with the Urology Clinic for removal of the ureteral stents at some point .
6. Infectious Disease :
Blood cultures mentioned previously were positive for C. perfringens .
She was started on vancomycin , levofloxacin , Flagyl , doxycycline and fluconazole .
Blood cultures drawn on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/01</PHI>/03 were negative .

Date :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Tennis</PHI> is a 65-year-old , white male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Utal Health</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Kennedy</PHI> with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to OM of the left circumflex .
The vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality .
In the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with Procainamide .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Carbon</PHI> , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
His Procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on Amiodarone .
However , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .
He took Nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms .
He came to the Emergency Room for evaluation .
In the Emergency Room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% O2 saturation .
He was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .
Iron deficiency anemia .
Hypertension .
Urosepsis in 1982 .
Peptic ulcer disease , resulting in gastrectomy .
A 2.5-cm. abdominal aortic aneurysm which was recently sizedat 3.5 cm .
Smoker for greater than 100 pack years ( 3-1/2 packs per day x 35 years ) .
No ethanol history .
Otherwise nonfocal .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Digoxin 0.25 mg. p.o. q. a.m. Coumadin 7.5 mg. p.o. q. d. Captopril 25 mg. p.o. q.i.d. Lasix 160 mg. in the morning and 80 mg. at night .
Isordil 10 mg. p.o. t.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure was 154/90 in the right and 150/82 in the left .
Pulse was varying between 120 and 140 .
He was afebrile .
His respiratory rate was 20 .
He had a furrowed tongue , but hisoropharynx was otherwise negative .
Cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate .
The PMI was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .
Heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .
An S2 split was not appreciated .
There were no murmurs .
Chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .
Abdominal exam revealed surgical scars and questionable hepatojugular reflux .
Liver was 10 cm. in width , 2 to 3 cm. below the rib .
Rectal exam was heme negative .
Extremities were warm with good distal pulses .
Neurologic exam was non focal .
Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were normal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Digoxin level was 1.3 .
The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable P-R interval , QRS of 0.09 , and QTC of 0.42 .
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
He was loaded on Amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed .
A right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 .
The ejection fraction was not calculated .
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no EKG changes during these episodes .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/22</PHI> , after an appropriate load of Amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .
He was reloaded back upon Coumadin and reached a therapeutic INR .
He was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 24th</PHI> with follow-up of his PT / PTT values on Friday , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">25th</PHI> , as well as three times a week in the following week , and follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Most</PHI> within two weeks .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Amiodarone 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for the first two weeks , decreasing to 200 mg. p.o. q.d. in the subsequent time .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/28</PHI>/76 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Melvean Ace</PHI> .
She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. &apos;s .
She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .
She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.
She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .
She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Avejoh Wierst</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Pedines Community Hospital</PHI> found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .
A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .
Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .
The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .
This was on diltiazem and digoxin .
Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .
We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .
She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .
Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/4</PHI> , and diltiazem was restarted .
A cardiac catheterization was carried out on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/5</PHI> , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .
There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .
Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .
With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .
A permanent pacemaker was put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/6</PHI>/92 .
This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
She tolerated the procedure well .
On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .
We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .
If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Avejoh Wierst</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Em Neighburce</PHI> .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
ASCENDING AORTIC DISSECTION PROCEDURE PERFORMED :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">List</PHI> is a 67 year-old diabetic woman with a known thoracic aortic dissection .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 29</PHI> , 1996 , the patient developed abdominal and back pain and presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Drain Hospital</PHI> .
A dissected descending thoracic aorta was diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiogram .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">En&apos;s Healthcare</PHI> for work-up .
She was intubated with pulmonary edema and followed by serial examinations .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January 2</PHI> CT scan of the chest showed a type III descending thoracic aortic aneurysm beginning distal to the left subclavian artery and ending above the renal artery .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January 4</PHI> , a CT scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , parenchymal consolidation right greater than left , aortic dissection with true and false lumens , well delineated flap with compression of the true lumen secondary to mass effect of thrombus in the false lumen .
There was a mediastinal hematoma .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January 23</PHI> , 1996 , the patient had a CT scan , again showing ascending aorta with low density abnormality , with findings suspicious for involvement of the ascending aorta by dissection , bilateral pleural effusions were improved .
The patient reports having been hospitalized for approximately one month , at which time she was discharged to a nursing home after refusing surgery .
The patient has had dyspnea on exertion since <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> , 1996 , increasing in the last month , and increasing abdominal distention .
The patient denies history of myocardial infarction or chest pain .
She does have shortness of breath and pedal edema .
She has had atrial fibrillation for five years .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She does orthopnea of three to four pillows .
The patient underwent CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 24</PHI> , 1997 , which demonstrated dissection of the ascending and archaorta to the root .
CT scan also demonstrated stable descending thoracic dissection with resolution of luminal compression .
Congestive heart failure .
Atrial fibrillation .
Hypertension .
Hiatal hernia .
History of gastrointestinal bleed on aspirin .
Status post appendectomy .
Status post umbilical hernia repair .
Status postventral hernia repair .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
History of 40 pack years smoking , quit in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> , 1996 .
Occasional ethanol .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfa , which gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS :
She is in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with irregular heart rate at 96 .
Blood pressure is 138/72 .
She is on room air at 90% .
Oropharynx showed poor dentition with apparent decay of the remaining teeth and gum recession .
The lungs demonstrated wheezes on auscultation with crackles at the bases .
Cardiovascular was irregularly irregular rhythm and rate .
Holosystolic murmur , II / VI , at the left lower sternal border .
The abdomen was obese , protuberant , nontender with well-healed surgical scars .
Extremities showed no clubbing or cyanosis .
Varicosities particularly left lower extremity front and back and right upper extremity medially .
There were 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally , 2+ radial pulses bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
Significant for white blood cell count of 6.8. BUN 14 , creatinine 1 .
Urinalysis was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for preoperative work-up prior to planned repair of her ascending aortic dissection .
The patient was evaluated by the Dental Service , who felt that it was necessary to extract several teeth and to follow several more , specifically tooth 15 and 16 , that were fully impacted .
The patient received periprocedure antibiotics .
The patient underwent echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 25</PHI> , 1997 , demonstrating 2/4+ tricuspid regurgitation with a peak velocity of 2.9 ; mitral regurgitation 2/4 , mild concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle ; no systolic function with mild septal hypokinesis .
The ejection fraction was estimated at 55% .
The aortic valve appeared sclerotic with mild to moderate insufficiency .
Dissection flap was noted .
There was pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 34 mmHg plus right atrial pressure .
There was also evidence of a secundum type atrioseptal defect , approximately 0.5 centimeters in size , with elevated right atrial pressure .
The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 25</PHI> , 1997 , demonstrating elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 19 , right ventricular pressure of 56/19 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/39 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24/26/21 .
Non selective coronary arteriography performed did not reveal the presence of any focal coronary artery disease .
The aortic root angiography revealed the presence of an extensive ascending aortic dissection .
True lumen could not be accessed from either the left or right femoral artery .
The true lumen required access by right radial artery and tortuous innominate artery .
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 26</PHI> , 1997 , where she underwent resection and repair of chronic aortic dissection and reconstruction of the super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 as well as primary repair of an atrioseptal defect which appeared consistent with a patent foramen ovale and was 1-2 centimeters insize .
On postoperative day number one , however , the patient was hemodynamically stable on a small amount of heparin and nitroglycerin with a cardiac index of 3 .
The patient required diuresis in her course after receiving multiple blood products .
Beta blocker was started as well .
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number three .
She did demonstrate evidence of a right brachial neuropathy , likely associated with the extensive dissection required for access to the right axillary artery , given the patient &apos;s distorted anatomy due to the large dissection .
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and received therapy to the right upper extremity and hand .
She will require continued therapy .
Otherwise the patient was neurologically intact .
The determination was made not to Coumadinize the patient given herchronic descending thoracic dissection and history of gastrointestinal bleeding .

LABORATORY DATA :
sodium 135 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 101 , C02 28.4 , BUN 17 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 302 , calcium 8.6 , phosphorus 2.5 , magnesium 1.6 , total protein 6.7 , albumin 3.3 , globulin 3.4 , uric acid 6.3 , totalbilirubin .7 , alkaline phosphatase 93 , SGOT 20 , LDH 258 , CPK 95 , whiteblood count 15.3 , hematocrit 49.7 , platelet count 159 , MCV 98 .
Chest x-ray <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 :
Elevated left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology or duration .
Postoperative changes of the sternum and media stinum were seen and no acute pulmonary disease was visualized .
A lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
The fracture fragments retained their proper site of articulation with the glenoid fossa .
No scapular fractures were present .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
The patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17</PHI>/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
No chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/12</PHI>/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Columbus Day</PHI> which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
After his procedure on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17</PHI>/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19</PHI>/97 to <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/20</PHI>/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .
4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :
GI was consulted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/15</PHI>/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
This report needs to be followed up , and will be available at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fordwoodall Stick</PHI> , in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156</PHI> .

Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/23</PHI>/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19</PHI>/97 showed moderate occult blood , pH 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS :
INTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY AT 23 WEEKS .
HYPERCALCEMIA .
IMPENDING SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION .
IDENTIFICATION DATA :
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a 22 week intrauterine pregnancy who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> with diffuse metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary .
The patient was in her usual state of excellent health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
Subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/23</PHI> , she was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Stonge</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
A fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
Subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/5</PHI> , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> under local anesthesia .
The patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nimaconwood Valley Hospital</PHI> for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .
Over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .
She has had no motor weakness , abnormal sensation , numbness , tingling or incontinence of bowel or bladder .
She denied fevers , chills or sweats .
Unremarkable .
MEDICATIONS :

Skin exam revealed a right posterior parietal scalp nodle measuring 2 x 3 cm which was very firm .
There was a 1 cm firm nodule in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen .
Neck was supple .
There was no lymphadenopathy .
Back was without CVA tenderness .
Lungs were clear to auscultation .
Cardiac exam was tachycardic and regular , normal S1 and S2 .
There was no heave .
Abdomen was gravid .
The liver was 11 cm by percussion .
There was no liver edge palpable , no spleen tip palpable .
Rectal revealed normal muscle tone , heme negative stool .
Extremities revealed 1+ bipedal edema on admission .
Neurological examination revealed the patient to be alert and oriented times three .
Motor was 5/5 .
Sensation was intact to light touch .
Deep tendon reflexes were 1-2+ and symmetric bilaterally .
Toes were downgoing .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included an ALT of 108 , AST of 286 .
Total bilirubin 3.0 , direct bilirubin of 2.0 .
Calcium 11.8 .
Albumin 2.3 .
PT was 13.2 .
PTT was 29.8 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/13</PHI>/91 .
The work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
A bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .
Work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .
The abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed no suspicious GI masses , no pancreatic mass ; a 2 cm ovarian cyst .
The review of the pathology from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> confirmed a high grade adenocarcinoma .
Erica and basic cystic protein stains are still pending .
Serum markers were normal .
The CEA was less than 0.7 .
The hCG on admission was 30,710 and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/19</PHI> was 805 .

The patient presented with a serum calcium of 11.8 and an albumin of 2.3 on admission .
She received three days of intravenous etidronate with normal saline diuresis and the serum calcium subsequently decreased to 9.0 .
The patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by CT scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic IVC .
This has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .
The patient &apos;s low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .
Although the patient &apos;s room air saturation was 96% during this admission , she subjectively complained of increased shortness of breath .
It was felt that the patient &apos;s extensive pulmonary metastases and bilateral pleural effusions resulted in increased work of respiration and a sensation of shortness of breath .
Impending spinal cord compression :
The MRI scan on admission revealed an impending cord compression at the level of T10 .
She was started on Decadron and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/17</PHI> began the first of ten radiation treatments to two fields ( T2 to T5 and T9 to T11 ) .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Linke</PHI> recommended chemotherapy with PFL .

Atrial fibrillation , hypertension , aortic valve disease , family history of coronary artery disease , hypothyroidism , and tobacco use .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
Right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography , and left ventriculogram .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 83-year-old woman under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenni Be</PHI> with a diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis .
She had a history of increasing dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath , orthopnea , and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
In addition , she noted palpitations but had a negative Holter monitor for tachy arrhythmias .
She is currently New York Heart Association functional class 3 .
A 2D echocardiogram showed mitral stenosis with a peak gradient of 23 , mean of 15 and a calculated mitral valve area of 0.9 cm. squared .
Her echo score was 10 .
There was more involvement of the lateral commissure and mild mitral regurgitation .
She also had mild aortic insufficiency , moderate tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 74 .
There was evidence of left-to-right shunting consistent with a patent foramen ovale prior to the trans-septal procedure .
She is now referred for PMV .
Synthroid , Vitamin E , Centrum , Potassium supplement , Lasix , Coumadin , Atenolol , and Ginkgo .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is a pleasant lady in no acute distress , blood pressure 130/70 , irregularly irregular pulses of 70 .
Jugular venous pressure normal and carotids normal .
Chest was clear .
Cardiac examination revealed an apical impulse at the fifth left intercostal space at mid clavicular line , right RV impulse was noted at the left sternal border .
First sound was increased but variable intensity , the second sound normally split with an increased P2 .
There was an opening snap followed by a long 2 out of 6 diastolic apical rumble .
There was no edema and there were good femoral pulses bilaterally .
SUMMARY :
The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where she was found to have a valve area of 0.6 cm. squared with a mean gradient of 20 .
She underwent successful PMV with a valve area increasing to 1.2 cm. squared and a gradient being reduced to 12 .
She did well overnight with no chest pain or shortness of breath .
She had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed prior to discharge , the results of which are pending at the time of this dictation .

Report Status :
Discharge Date :
1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .
2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/17</PHI>/91 .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
He was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> as an out-patient .
He was evaluated in the Emergency Room .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .
Cultures were taken and he was sent out .
He was seen in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">FLFDMC</PHI> where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .
3) Status post right elbow surgery .
4) Venereal disease history .
The patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .
SKIN :
Jaundiced .
Revealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .
NECK :
He had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .
LUNGS :
Had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .
CARDIAC :
Showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .
His liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .
His spleen was not palpable .
RECTAL :
He had guaiac positive stools .
EXTREMITIES :
Unremarkable .
His penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .
NEUROLOGICAL :
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
PT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .
Sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .
ALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .
( On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/06</PHI> , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .
His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .
His chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .
However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/11</PHI>/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/11</PHI>/91 .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/12</PHI>/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/13</PHI>/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
No other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/16</PHI>/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/18</PHI>/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.
DISPOSITION :
An autopsy will be performed .
An autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .

WORD DISABILITY AND PROBABLY DURATION :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotereef</PHI> is a <PHI TYPE="AGE">93-year-old</PHI> woman who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daleglo Medical Center</PHI> with renal insufficiency .
The patient was in her usual state of health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/10</PHI>/98 when she was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daleglo Medical Center</PHI> with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes .
She was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days .
The patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
She has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness .
The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
On arrival to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her systolic blood pressure was 110 .
Her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
A chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .
A KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 25</PHI> where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .
There was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient &apos;s diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .
The patient had been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
She was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
Multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .
There was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .
The patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
Her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .
Her BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .
The patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .
Her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .
However , with the assistance of the patient &apos;s granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .
I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .
The patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .
I will get in touch with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Areas</PHI> and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .

She has a history of esophageal varices and a history of an Upper GI bleed .
She has had one pervious episode of variceal bleeding with an unclear date .
However she is followed by a Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Joasscchird</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vaila Medical Center</PHI> .
She also had some black , tarry stool in her colostomy bag .
She had an upper endoscopy at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Va Sit Namar Healthcare</PHI> showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .
She was started on Pitressin , a Blakemore tube was inserted .
She was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Intensive Care Unit where on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 25</PHI> in the morning her hematocrit was found to be 27.4 .
She was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .
The GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .
Her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .
after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

Notable for sodium 141 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 109 , bicarb 19.8 , BUN 38 , creatinine 1.2 and glucose 388 .
She had a pneumonia of 31 , calcium was 7.5 , phosphorous 3.0 , magnesium 1.3 .
Her bilirubin was 1.4 total , 0.2 direct .
alkaline phosphatase 101 .
SGPT 22 , SGOT 41 , amylase 31 , lipase less than 1 .
LDH was 38.9 , CK was 66 , her hematocrit was 27.4 , white count was 8.0 and her platelets were 55 .
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
Her PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .
The rest of her labs were unremarkable .
She was watched very closely while on the floor .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 26</PHI> when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
She therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
By the <PHI TYPE="DATE">2th</PHI> the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">North Dakota</PHI> .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Joasscchird</PHI> , tel. <PHI TYPE="PHONE">090-249-6079</PHI> , at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Va Sit Namar Healthcare</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Acrookesjo</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Do Of Hospital</PHI> , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">AH</PHI> and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Acrookesjo</PHI> in one week and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Work</PHI> the gastrointestinal fellow here at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">PUOMC</PHI> in 2 weeks .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
dementia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
She was reportedly incontinent of urine and diaphoretic .
Her PO intake has also decreased .
The head computerized tomography scan on admission to the emergency room revealed moderate to severe cortical atrophy without evidence of acute bleed or subdural hemorrhage .
The patient denies shortness of breath , chest pain or abdominal pain .
The patient has a history of major depression / psychotic depression since at least 1988 .
She does have paranoid features .
The patient has a history of near syncope in 1988 and also a history of dehydration .
Currently the patient is unable to provide history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
vitamin B12 shots monthly .
The patient lives with elderly siblings .
FAMILY HISTORY :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm with normal Sl and S2 .
Extremities :
revealed one plus edema bilaterally .
The neurological examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented only to self .
LABORATORY DATA :
revealed sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 26.4 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose was 124 .
The complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 11,900 ; hematocrit of 38 and platelet count of 207,000 ; the tox screen was negative .
The prothrombin time was 10.1 and partial thromboplastin time 28.5 .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with axis of 0 degrees and normal intervals .
There were no ST-T wave changes .
Head computerized tomography scan revealed diffuse cortical atrophy , increased ventricles and no acute bleed .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Dehydration .
The patient was mildly dehydrated at time of admission and was replaced with intravenous fluids until she began taking good PO intake .
By the end of her hospitalization she was eating well on her own .
2. Infectious Disease .
Admission urinalysis revealed 5-10 red blood cells , 10-20 white blood cells and few bacteria .
The antibiotics were discontinued after three days of intravenous antibiotic therapy .
3. Psychiatric .
The patient underwent neuropsychiatric testing .
This evaluation revealed a woman with multifaceted loss of intellectual functioning who falls well within the range of SDAT group .
Conclusion was that this was a dementing process .
The testing was performed by a staff neuropsychologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lornsook Trusmoag</PHI> , PhD , telephone number <PHI TYPE="PHONE">959-1490</PHI> .
Approximately five days into the hospital stay it was noted that the patient had significant right parotid swelling .
Plain films revealed soft tissue swelling , neck and face computerized tomography scan revealed a nonspecific enlarged right parotid gland with increased attenuation consistent with an inflammatory or neoplastic process .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so a contrast study was not available .
Cytology consult was called , but by the time the cytologist came to do a fine needle aspiration the mass had shrunken to the point where there was nothing to aspirate .
It was felt that attempting a biopsy and beginning antibiotic treatment was not indicated at this time as the mass had entirely resolved .
The ENT physician who saw the patient is Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freieslowkays</PHI> .
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freieslowkays</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 8</PHI> , 1994 at 1:20 p.m. at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital</PHI> .
The phone number is <PHI TYPE="PHONE">610-7597</PHI> .
5. Physical Therapy .
However , she has been reluctant to even move from the bed to the chair since admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
Fear of falling seems to be a large component of this , and the patient will likely need considerable patience in convincing her it is okay to get out of bed again .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
The patient is a 73-year-old white man status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 admitted for catheterization for evaluation of the current anginal symptoms and a positive exercise tolerance test .
The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 because of unstable angina with LIMA to the LAD and SVG to the OMB and PDA .
The patient was free of angina until six weeks prior to admission when he began to have anginal symptoms described as a heaviness beginning in the scapula , moving to the retrosternal chest and radiating to the left shoulder with no other associated symptoms .
These anginal episodes occurred after exercise and also at rest resolving in two to five minutes .
An exercise tolerance test on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21</PHI>/92 was stopped at seven minutes because of fatigue and chest pain .
There were positive EKG changes in the inferolateral leads and thallium showed a reversible ischemia in the inferoapical region .
Addition of diltiazem to the patient &apos;s aspirin and Dyazide medical treatment had no improvement in symptoms .
The patient had no symptoms of congestive heart failure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient started Leukorin treatment two days prior to admission for a white count of 100,000 .
Hyperlipidemia .
Left total hip replacement in 1988 .
Low back pain .
Right internal carotid artery stenosis of 80-90% diagnosed by carotid noninvasives after an episode of amaurosis fugax .
Gout .
Skin cancer .
MEDICATIONS :
On admission included diltiazem CD , 240 mg po q day ; Isordil , 5 mg po t.i.d. ; aspirin , one po q.o.d. ; Dyazide , one po q.o.d. ; allopurinol , 300 mg po q day ; Levoxine , 0.1 mg q day ; Leukorin , 2 mg two po q a.m.
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Negative except for increasing fatigue in the past two weeks and leg cramps at night .
On admission revealed a blood pressure of 158/88 .
Pulse 70 .
Physical examination was significant for ulcerated fungating lesions on his left ear , dorsum of his hands .
Lungs were clear .
The liver was 10 cm by percussion .
There were palpable inguinal lymph nodes .
Neurological exam was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Platelet count 104,000 .
BUN / creatinine 26/1.4 .
Potassium 4.4 .
The patient underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/2</PHI>/92 which showed the following :
Cardiac output 6.7 .
Cardiac index 3.2 .
Angiography showed an occluded SVG graft to OM1 , patent SVG graft to the RCA , patent LIMA to the LAD .
There was also 50% occlusion of the left proximal circumflex , 95% occlusion of the right proximal coronary artery , 50% occlusion of the OMB1 , 90% occlusion of the mid LAD .
The patient then underwent PTCA of the distal RCA lesion .
Because of difficulty passing the wire through the graft to the RCA , the proximal 95% RCA lesion was dilated first and then the distal RCA lesion was dilated .
The patient received 600 cc of contrast and the PTCA procedure took approximately three hours .
The patient did not experience any chest pain during the procedure and has not had any chest pain since the procedure .
The sheaths were removed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/4</PHI>/92 and heparin was restarted four hours after sheath removal and maintained for two days because of a possible small dissection in the RCA .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 25 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/4</PHI>/92 .
Repeat hematocrit showed it to be stable at 27 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/5</PHI> .
The patient was asymptomatic except for some back pain from lying flat after the catheterization procedures .
His vital signs remained stable .
He is to be discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/6</PHI> with follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Kote</PHI> , his cardiologist and with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Right</PHI> , his hematologist .

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems is significant for a history of dyspnea on exertion .
At present , she can walk one to two blocks before having to stop because of shortness of breath .
When walking outside , she stops multiple times because of shortness of breath .
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination is notable for pupils which have irregular border and are very sluggishly reactive .
The patient reports that she will have revision of cataract surgery .
Cardiovascular exam :
She is guaiac negative on rectal examination .
Extremities :
unremarkable .
Admission white blood count 4.3 , hematocrit 31.0 , electrolytes were all within normal limits , glucose 218 , prothrombin time on admission was 15.1 with INR of 1.5 , partial thromboplastin time 23.3 .
Impression was that this was an 83-year-old female with cardiac history , dyspnea on exertion , increased calcium and hyperparathyroidism who presents for parathyroidectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On the day of admission , the patient was brought to the operating room for parathyroidectomy .
The right superior parathyroid gland was found to be markedly enlarged and consistent with an adenoma .
Her right superior parathyroid gland was removed and the rest of her parathyroid glands were left in place .
Postoperatively , the patient did well and was able to cough and phonate completely with no changes from preoperative .
The plan was to start her on heparin and Coumadin and discontinue her heparin when her Coumadin levels became therapeutic as judged by the prothrombin time / INR .
However , on postoperative day number two , the patient in the afternoon noticed some tingling in her hands and also some tingling hear her perioral region .
She had a negative Chvostek &apos;s and negative Trousseau &apos;s sign .
An ionized calcium was drawn which was low at 1.0 .
As a result , the patient was started on Os-Cal 250 mg PO q.i.d. On postoperative day number three , her ionized calcium was 1.06 and her Os-Cal was increased to 500 q.i.d.
However , her ionized calcium decreased to 0.97 and she was given one amp of calcium gluconate .
On postoperative day number five , the patient felt fine and had an INR of 1.9 with a prothrombin time of 16.6 .
Her calcium was 8.5 , albumin 3.6 , and phosphate 4.5 .
She had had no further episodes of tingling in her fingers after the initial episode which had prompted us originally to draw the ionized calcium .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
5. Rocaltrol 0.25 mg PO b.i.d. ,
6. Lasix 40 mg PO q.day ,
7. Norvasc 5 mg PO q.day ,
8. Digoxin .25 mg PO q.day ,
9. Lopressor 50 mg PO b.i.d. ,
10. Glucotrol 10 mg qam .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
There was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur .
Plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .
The Radiation Service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .
Planning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the Radiation Service .
She was also seen by the Dermatology Service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis .
She was given Synalar Cream and Eucerin Cream as a moisturizer .

11) HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a long history of alcohol abuse , withdrawal seizures , and hypopharyngeal cancer now admitted with foreign body in hypopharynx .
The patient has a long history of alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease as well as seizure disorder related to alcohol withdrawal and multiple <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> admissions for detox and multiple detox facilities in the past .
The patient also recently ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">06</PHI>/93 ) was diagnosed with infiltrating cancer of the hypopharynx and was scheduled to undergo XRT but had not yet started .
On the day of admission the patient was in a detox center undergoing detox prior to beginning his XRT and was in his usual state of health at that time when he had the acute onset of coughing after swallowing some chicken a la king .
The patient also was noted to have secretions draining from his mouth .
He was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Stamgibonnole Hospital</PHI> for further evaluation .
In the Emergency Room the patient underwent EGD by GI where a large piece of chicken was visualized at the level of the cricopharyngeus .
Despite multiple attempts at extraction at that point they were unable to extract the foreign body and it was felt that the patient should be admitted and attempt extraction later in the afternoon .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Alcohol abuse complicated by hepatitis , cirrhosis , seizure disorder , encephalopathy .
4) Hypopharyngeal cancer .
5) Chronic right lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray noted to be probable scarring vs. fat pad .
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , shellfish , Doxycycline , also the patient had rash with Ceclor .
MEDICATIONS :
On transfer included Dilantin 100 mg po t.i.d. , Ceclor , Motrin , Percocet p.r.n.
On admission he is a disheveled elderly male uncooperative with the exam .
Vital signs revealed the patient was afebrile , blood pressure 150/90 , pulse 86 and regular , respiratory rate 24 , and oxygen saturation 91% on room air .
HEENT exam revealed sclerae were injected , pupils equal and reactive .
Neck exam no JVD or lymphadenopathy .
Chest exam coarse upper airway sounds , no rales .
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Abdominal exam obese , hypoactive bowel sounds , non-tender , some guarding , no rebound tenderness .
Extremities with trace pedal edema , 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses .
On admission Hct 42.1 , white count 7.6 , platelets 132 .
Dilantin level 13.7 .
UA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .
By systems -
Extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .
EGD was performed .
Subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .
There was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .
The patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/22</PHI>/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .
The patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .
The patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .
2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .
A swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .
He was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient &apos;s mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .
Other options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient &apos;s poor prognosis for the future .
The family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient &apos;s nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .
It is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .
The chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .
However , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .
The patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .
5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .
6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .
Psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .
7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .
It was decided the patient &apos;s code status would not be DNR , DNI .
He underwent extraction of all his teeth on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21</PHI>/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a GI bleed .
Laboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .
CBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/27</PHI>/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .
A faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .
OPERATIVE PROCEDURES :
Extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21</PHI>/93 .
COMPLICATIONS :
1) Aspiration pneumonia .
2) GI bleed .
DISPOSITION :
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">8/22</PHI>/96 , drainage of intraabdominal abscess .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">8/21</PHI>/96 , incision and drainage of right thigh .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">9/3</PHI>/96 , transverse colostomy .
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Daie Elms</PHI> was a 50-year-old male , who underwent cadaveric renal transplant in 1992 , who presented with a three-week old scrape of the right popliteal fossa related to a prosthesis .
The wound became progressively indurated with drainage , and he presented for evaluation and treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Prednisone .
Procardia .
Pravachol .
Imuran .
Epogen .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an obese man in no acute distress .
His blood pressure was 174/60 ; temperature 103.4 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination was remarkable for poor dentition .
The neck was supple without adenopathy .
The chest examination was remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally , with regular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and obese .
The genitourinary examination was notable for a suprapubic tube in place with normal male genitalia and guaiac negative stools on rectal examination .
Extremity examination revealed bilateral below-knee amputations with a 2 x 4 centimeter area of inflammation in the right popliteal fossa with a draining sinus .
LABORATORY DATA :
At the time of admission , BUN and creatinine were 89 and 4.4 ; white blood count 19.3 ; hematocrit 21.9 ; PT 15.1 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Cultures from his abdomen subsequently grew out methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
His nutrition remained poor throughout this time in spite of numerous attempts at enteral alimentation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/26</PHI>/96 , the patient had a hypotensive bradycardic arrest at the end of a dialysis run .
He became increasingly more unresponsive and remained quite septic and febrile , resistant to aggressive antibiotic treatment .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
He continued to deteriorate until <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/96 , at which time he became bradycardic and asystolic .
He had no spontaneous cardiac or neurologic activity at this time , and he was declared dead at 12:15 A.M. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/96 .
The family was notified , but declined a postmortem examination .

Ativan .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Temperature was 102 , heart rate was 110 , respiratory rate was 22 , blood pressure was 113/63 .
His neck was supple .
Lungs :
Rales at the right base , bilateral decreased breath sounds at the bases .
Cor :
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no extra heart sounds , abdomen distended with an epigastric mass noted , mildly tender to palpation , no guarding .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count was 14.4 , hematocrit was 36.2 , platelet count was 217 , sodium was 135 , potassium was 3.3 , chloride was 99 , bicarbonate was 25 , BUN was 40 , creatinine was 1.9 , glucose was 124 , urinalysis was negative , PT was 12.2 , PTT was 24.5 , calcium was 7.8 , phosphorus was 3.7 , albumin was 2.3 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , alkaline phosphatase was 202 , SGPT was 32 , SGOT was 64 , LDH was 998 , amylase was 150 .
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 107 beats per minute .
Large left ventricle , bilateral atelectasis or effusion .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan :
Pancreatitis , fluid collection in the lesser sac .
Gallbladder was visualized with stones .
The patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .
He was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
The fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/28</PHI>/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/27</PHI> .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
Approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
He remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/15</PHI>/95 .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
By the end of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , it became clear that Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .
After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Douet</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
History of multinodular goiter ; history of hypertension ; history of subtotal thyroidectomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Lenkpruskihkooglekih</PHI> is a 63-year-old lady with a history of frequent premature ventricular contractions and infrequent short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ( one four-beat run ) in 1991 , for which several antiarrhythmic agents including Propranolol , Quinidine , Procainamide , Tenormin , Norpace , Corgard , and Flecainide were used , but were stopped because of intolerance .
At that time , she had clear coronary arteries on coronary angiography and an ejection fraction greater than 50% .
She did well off antiarrhythmic agents until <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of this year when she was noted to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate after several days of decreased exercise tolerance .
She was started on Coumadin and had a failed attempt at DC electrical cardioversion on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/16</PHI>/96 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

SUMMARY PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
DUODENAL PERFORATION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 60 year-old gentleman with a past medical history of gastric lymphoma status post total gastrectomy / splenectomy in 1991 with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction .
The patient noted onset of diffuse abdominal pain , periumbilical and epigastric in nature , nausea and vomiting and back pain starting at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission , <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/00 .
The patient denies fevers , chills or sweats , shortness of breath or chest pain .
He had a normal bowel movement the day prior to admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
History of small bowel obstruction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/17</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/15</PHI> , pancytopenia , history of right renal calculus .
Splenectomy , total gastrectomy as above , for gastric lymphoma for which he also received chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
White blood cell count 4.5 , hematocrit 31.9 , creatinine 1.1 .
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 65 , blood pressure 101/74 , 100 percent oxygen saturation on room air .
ABDOMEN :
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted after placement of a nasogastric tube and was brought emergently to the operating room after a CT scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .
There was no evidence of perforation on the CT scan .
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .
This was taken down and the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .
However by the mid morning of the <PHI TYPE="DATE">14th of March</PHI> , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .
The patient was invasively lined with a Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .
At this point the patient &apos;s creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for the prospect of sepsis given his neutropenia and previous splenectomy and then an echocardiogram was performed to assess left ventricular function .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/14</PHI>/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .
Upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .
However prior to this it was also noted that the patient &apos;s scrotum was necrotic .
An incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .
The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .
Upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic-like picture and was maintained on Neo-Synephrine .
It should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have a pancreatitis by enzymes .
therefore the patient went back to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/15</PHI>/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .
Further debridement was undertaken .
The patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .
The patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16</PHI>/00 the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .
Unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .
The patient &apos;s family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16</PHI>/00 .
The patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/17</PHI>/00 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Unstable angina pectoris .
2. Congestive heart failure .
3. Chronic renal failure , hemodialysis dependent .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">5/18</PHI>/99 Coronary artery bypass graft using the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and posterior left ventricular artery and the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with accelerating angina pectoris , who had a cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Chimass Community Hospital</PHI> revealing three-vessel disease .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for a cardiac surgical evaluation .
The patient &apos;s cardiac history has been known for several years .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>/96 , the patient had a cardiac catheterization that revealed a moderate right coronary artery ostial lesion , severe lesion at the ostial PLV , 50-60% circumflex lesion , 40% proximal left anterior descending , and severe proximal D1 .
The patient was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bitamp Memorial</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/11</PHI>/99 , having had three episodes of chest pain .
She had a repeat cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Chimass Community Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/13</PHI>/99 , which showed three-vessel disease , including right coronary artery 70% ostial , left anterior descending 70% , circumflex 100% .
Her ejection fraction was estimated at 60% .
There was 1 mitral regurgitation .
The patient was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
The patient was brought to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/18</PHI>/99 , where a coronary artery bypass graft x 4 was performed .
The bypasses are listed above .
The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells .
She received 1 unit of normal saline .
Postoperatively , the patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
Her chest tubes were removed , as per protocol .
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was routine .
Prior to her transfer to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 12 Unit</PHI> , her last cardiac index in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit had been between 2.0 and 2.2 .
2. Renal :
The patient was dialyzed , as stated above , and had fluid taken off in order to approach her preoperative weight .
Endocrine :
The patient was followed by the Diabetes / Endocrine Service .
Her NPH and regular insulin doses were adjusted accordingly .
Her regular insulin consisted of insulin sliding scale .
4. Infectious Disease :
The patient was thought to have had rigors during one of her dialysis sessions .
However , it should be stated that all of her cultures while at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> were negative for growth .
As such , antibiotics should not be continued .
It should be pointed out , however , that a urinalysis from <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/14</PHI>/99 showed positive white blood cells .
However , this was in the setting of the patient , who more than likely has colonization of her bladder secondary to decreased to no urine output .
At the time of discharge , the patient was in satisfactory condition , tolerating good PO intake on her renal diet .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
NPH insulin 25 units subq q AM .
Aspirin 81 mg. PO QD .
Phoslo 6 mg. PO TID .
Epogen 4000 units IV on Tuesdays and Wednesdays .
At the time of discharge , the patient was planned to go to rehabilitation .
Discharge follow up will be with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Burgeshuff</PHI> &apos;s service ( <PHI TYPE="PHONE">438-9748</PHI> ) .
The patient should also follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Cord</PHI> of Cardiology .

Admission Date :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/16</PHI>/1991
Report Status :
Discharge Date :
HISTORY :
Coincident with the angioplasty he received a large contrast load leading to the development of renal failure and hemodialysis .
He also has had bilateral carotid endarterectomy and right aorto-femoral bypass .
The patient had done well until about two weeks prior to admission when he started developing several episodes of chest pain with minimal exertion .
He was admitted when he failed medical therapies for a diagnostic catheterization to evaluate his saphenous grafts and his native coronary circulation .
On admission physical exam he had a blood pressure of 152/92 , pulse 80 and regular , respirations 18 .
On cardiac exam he had a slightly diffuse point of maximal impulse , normal S1 , split S2 , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the left sternal border , positive S4 .
The carotids were one plus with bruits bilaterally .
The left femoral is barely perceptible , right femoral two plus with a bruit .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram on admission was normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis , left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 17</PHI> , 1991 , the patient had a catheterization that showed an occluded proximal right coronary artery with the PDA filling via left to right collaterals , an occluded left circumflex after the OMB2 , and a very proximal occlusion of the LAD .
The patient had recurrent chest pain at rest in the hospital .
Antianginals were increased and including Procardia was increased to 90 q.d.
These changes in his medical regiment seemed to significantly improve his angina .
We were very reluctant to recommend further invasive interventions in view of his dissuse atherosclerosis and renal failure , which make him a very high risk candidate for further PTCAs .
During the hospitalization the patient was dialyzed for his renal failure .
On presentation he had a hematocrit of 29.5 secondary to renal failure .
He was transfused during the hospitalization .
He was discharged in stable condition on the following medications :
Procardia XL , 90 mg p.o. q.d. ; Lopressor , 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; nitroglycerine 1/150 1 tab s.l. p.r.n. pain ; Nitrol patch , 10 mg q.a.m. ; iron sulfate , 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nephrocaps , 1 tab. p.o. q.d. ; Xanax , 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
He is to have a low cholesterol , low fat renal diet .
Activities as tolerated .

Hypoglycemia leading to question seizure , non ST-elevation MI , GI bleed , anemia .
Question seizure / loss of consciousness with hypoglycemia , fingerstick blood sugar of 24 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
An 82-year-old male with a history of CAD status post CABG , CVA status post CEA , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , GI bleeding , CHF with an EF of 35% , left lower lobe pneumonia on admission on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/22</PHI>/04 - <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/31</PHI>/2004 , PVD and bladder cancer .
Of note , the patient has had melena times months with multiple blood transfusions at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Usoak Rinix Hospital</PHI> .
The patient , after having his melanotic stool , had a question seizure-like activity with question loss of consciousness .
EMS was called and found the patient &apos;s fingerstick blood sugar to be 24 .
The patient at that time had slurred speech with altered mental status .
The patient at the site was given 1 amp of D50 .
The patient was transferred to the ED .
Of note , in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Genearocktemp Ry Health</PHI> ED the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 23.7 down from low 30s , a troponin of 5.8 , and an EKG with afib showing peak T-waves .
Of note , the patient had a previously scheduled EGD for <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/17</PHI> .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
Ischemia :
The patient is status post a non ST elevation MI , a troponin peaked at 22 likely secondary to dehydration and presentation of acute renal failure .
The patient was managed on a beta blocker .
Pump :
Of note , the patient was transfused for a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells during this admission .
Repeat echo revealed an EF of 45-50% with inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis .
Overall , the patient had preserved LV function despite a large troponin leak .
2. GI :
A GI consult was obtained and the patient had adequate IV access .
The patient was started on Protonix IV 40 b.i.d.
Per GI consult given the patient &apos;s non ST elevation MI he would be a high risk candidate for a GI endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non ST elevation MI period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective GI workup in 4-6 weeks .
The patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but no evidence of bright red blood per rectum or large amounts of melena .
On the date of discharge the patient has stools that are only trace guaiac positive .
On admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
The patient &apos;s fingersticks were in the 150s without any coverage .
The patient was restarted on a low dose glipizide at 2.5 mg and adjustments to be made at the next PCP visit .
Hematocrit is stable .
Has remained stable above 30 without any need for further transfusions .
Over the last several days the patient received a total of 4 units packed red blood cells during this admission .
On discharge his hematocrit is 35.4 .
However , his urine cultures were positive for MRSA and the patient completed a seven day course of Vancomycin IV .
We have a low threshold for starting antibiotics ; however , chest x-ray reveals no acute changes and the patient remained 96% on room air throughout this admission without any stigmata over recurrent pneumonia including cough , dyspnea or shortness of breath .
7. Renal :
The patient came in with a creatinine that was elevated at 2.6 .
CODE STATUS :
Code is DNR / DNI .
TO DO PLAN :
1. The patient is to follow up with PCP , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Toob Obestimeuph</PHI> in two weeks .
3. The patient is deconditioned secondary to his week long hospital stay and long rehabilitation stay and will require aggressive physical therapy .

Otherwise , the SMA 20 was within normal limits .
White count was 5.5 , hematocrit was 43.5 , and MCV was 9l .
Platelet count was 350,000 .
Differential included 66 polys , 24 lymphocytes , 3 monocytes , and l eosinophil .
Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of l.0l5 , a pH of 8.0 , l+ ketones , and no blood .
Chest X-Ray showed hyperinflation bilaterally and loss of the anterior clear space on the lateral film likely secondary to arm position since the patient was unable to raise up her arm from weakness stemming from her multiple sclerosis .
EKG showed baseline artifacts , sinus tachycardia at l05 , PR interval of 0.l6 , QRS of 0.08 , QT of 0.36 , an axis of 60 degrees , poor R wave progression with transition after the V4 lead , T wave flattening in II and F , and T wave inversion in III .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Multiple sclerosis - The patient underwent lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an IgG to albumin ratio of 0.485 .
Cell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one .
Patient also had an MRI scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis .
Serum IgG was elevated at l,520 .
SPEP showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits .
The patient underwent <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital</PHI> multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .
She tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .
This was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .
She received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .
2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point .
She had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis .
Work-up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .
Haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal LDH .
This was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .
A clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .
She did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .
Patient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , and the <PHI TYPE="DATE">Septemberth of 2006</PHI> to assure that her hematocrit recovers .
3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/15</PHI>/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
Subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .
Patient received a seven day course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .
DISPOSITION :
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Multivitamins one tablet p.o. q.d. , Halcion 0.l25 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. ( forty tablets , no refills ) , and Acthar 40 units intramuscularly q.d. times two days and then 20 units intramuscularly q.d. times three days .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
NAME :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">HIBBSLIRES , LOJOA M</PHI>
UNIT NUMBER :
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatitis B-related cirrhosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
(2) Hepatic encephalopathy .
(3) Grade I esophageal varices .
(4) Hepatic hydrothorax on the right .
(5) peptic ulcer disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Repeated pleurocentesis .
Chest tube placement on the right .
Endotracheal intubation .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 60-year-old Mandarin speaking gentleman , with a long history of end-stage liver disease secondary to Hepatitis B. infection diagnosed approximately six years prior to admission , who now presents with recurrence of right-sided hydrothorax thought to be related as an ascitic equivalent on the right side .
It was tapped and drained with placement of a chest tube .
The patient was evaluated by the Liver Transplant Service , and on the end of his first week of admission , became increasingly somnolent with exam findings consistent with evolving hepatic encephalopathy .
In the Intensive Care Unit , his chest tube continued to have massive volume output , and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid .
Blood cultures in this setting grew out Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic coverage was altered to cover this organism appropriately .
During the first week of <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> in spite of antibiosis , the patient developed worsening renal failure , became anuric , and developed rapid progression in spite of his chest tube of the right-sided hydrothorax in addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome vs. extreme volume overload .
He became dependent on pressers .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th of February</PHI> , the patient had an extremely large volume gastrointestinal bleed , and worsened hepatic encephalopathy .
In consultation with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leynslentnerswaimjesc</PHI> and with his gastrointestinal physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Loydbreunlinke</PHI> , and with the patient &apos;s family , the decision was made in the setting of his grim prognosis and multiple morbidities that further aggressive treatment would not be pursued .
The patient was evaluated for continuous venous venous hemodialysis , which in the end in the setting of the family &apos;s wishes , was not begun with this patient .
The time of death was 5:16 A.M. on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th of February</PHI> , 1997 .
The family was present .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1) RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY PSEUDOMONAS CELLULITIS .
3) CORD COMPRESSION .
4) STEROID INDUCED DIABETES MELLITUS .
8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .
He underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>/92 at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Petersly Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
A workup done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">DE</PHI> is not available at the time of this dictation .
He has been on Decadron since <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .
He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/20</PHI>/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .
There was evidence of cord compression .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Petersly Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lorough Medical Center</PHI> &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Multiple myeloma .
2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .
4) Chronic renal insufficiency .
6) Failed autologous bone marrow transplant in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>/92 .
Positive for diabetes mellitus .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
ALLERGIES :
Question of penicillin and sulfa drugs leading to a rash .
MEDICATIONS :
On transfer include Vancomycin , Ceftazidime , gentamicin , Solu Cortef 100 mg q8h , Lasix , Synthroid , insulin , MS Contin 60 mg b.i.d. , MSO4 2 mg p.r.n. pain IV , Dopamine 12 mcg per minute .

Abdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
Extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .
There was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .
Neurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .
Cranial nerves intact .
Motor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .
Strength was decreased in both lower extremities .
Coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .
Glucose 191 .
Magnesium 1.7 .
UA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .
There was no CSF density .
These findings were consistent with the cord compression .
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/25</PHI>/94 .
In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/94 .
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
urinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , Parkinson &apos;s disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> with a fever .
He reports lower abdominal pain x&apos;s 2 days .
Of note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his Parkinson &apos;s disease .
His wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 .
They went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for admission .
He was recently started on a Texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
ALLERGIES :
He had no known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .
There was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from Ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia .
He was continued on his Parkinson &apos;s medications .
He was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms .
Bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration .
He did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued .
Thus , he was considered ready for discharge .
He again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated .
He was switched over the Clinda and Gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/10</PHI>/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic .
Brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
He was hypotensive into the 80s .
RV leads were negative for ST elevation .
A portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .
Anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .
The right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery .
The patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .
He was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on Dobutamine for pressure support .
He was dynamically stable on his Dobutamine with improved oxygenation .
The patient continued fairly stable while intubated .
Two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of Dobutamine .
He had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .
Discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities .
They were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction .
An echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus .
They did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .
The repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .
Discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .
He was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .
The patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .
No further blood draws were done .
The patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous Morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .
Comfort measures continued until the day <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 , where Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Koteleebdils</PHI> was found to be pulseless , without respirations .
He was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 .
The family and the attending physician were notified .

Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Rule</PHI> is a 75 year old woman who is status post sigmoid resection for Duke &apos;s C2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/8</PHI>/96 with abdominal pain and neutropenia .
She first presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1990 with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke &apos;s B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .
She then represented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1996 with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .
She underwent a sigmoid resection on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/17</PHI>/96 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenni Pain</PHI> .
Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .
One of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .
She was therefore staged Dukes C2 .
An abdominal CT scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .
A chest x-ray was read as clear .
She is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .
She began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .
She was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aacent Slentjae</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Linatpromehack Worth Hospital</PHI> for Radiation Therapy .
She began treatment on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/20</PHI>/96 .
Her course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> .
An MRI was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/25</PHI>/96 to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .
She presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/8</PHI>/96 with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .
She denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in 1992.
(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .
Cardiac catheterization showed sequential LAD and she underwent angioplasty twice to the LAD with good results .
An echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 1994 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% .
Her baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block .
(4) Osteoporosis .
(5) Hypercholesterolemia .
(7) Status post appendectomy .
(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenni Pain</PHI> .
Her abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .
An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .
However , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .
These findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .
She was admitted and made NPO .
She was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
Her ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .
She was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .
She was also placed on neutropenic precautions .
However , repeated abdominal x-rays and CT scans continued to show no signs of obstruction or perforation .
However , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .
Of note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .
Of note , shortly after starting on her TPN her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and TPN was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .
She was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
We recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .
During this time she will continue to receive TPN .
After that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .
Her small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Insulin sliding scale b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day , Neutra-phos 500 mg p.o. q. day , metopromide 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets one sublingually q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , nizatidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea , nafcillin dose 4 mg in 24 hours , and TPN .
Make sure her TPN at this point is 6% amino acids and 15% dextrose and 400 kilo calories of lipids , total volume is 1.6 liters and it is to be administered over 20 hours .
In addition to the above , she has the following additives :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Rule</PHI> is to follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Chelkjescchalsere</PHI> , who can be reached at <PHI TYPE="PHONE">148-701-5440</PHI> .

Discharge Date :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">03/22</PHI>/1992
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Prostate cancer .
2. Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient was initially diagnosed with prostate cancer in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 1989 .
He presented with gross hematuria at that time .
The patient was admitted in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1991 for urinary retention and acute renal failure and was treated with fluid rehydration and Foley catheter placement .
Over the past one month prior to admission , the patient &apos;s wife has noticed a marked decrease in p.o. intake and also noted a weight loss of approximately ten pounds in the preceding two weeks .
The patient has been lethargic and bed ridden for the past two weeks , although there was no evidence of fever or chills over this time .
The patient is now admitted for fluid rehydration therapy and observation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
None currently .
ALLERGIES :
HABITS :
No history of cigarette smoking .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is afebrile with a recumbent blood pressure of 128/16 , pulse of 76 , and standing blood pressure of 110/60 with a pulse of 88 .
Respirations are unlabored at 16 .
HEENT :
Noted for nonicteric sclerae and lungs that are clear to auscultation .
No CVA tenderness was appreciated in the heart and the heart appears to be in regular rate and rhythm .
EXTREMITIES :
Without cyanosis or edema .
Soft and nontender .
SKIN :
Decreased turgor with dry mucous membranes .
Urinalysis demonstrated 30-50 white blood cells with red blood cells too numerous to count and 2+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Initially , the patient was begun on Bactrim for presumptive urinary tract infection and the initial course of his hospitalization , he took p.o.&apos; s poorly .
By hospital day number six , however , the patient became febrile to 100.7 and repeat urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells and 1+ bacteria .
The patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated ; however , by hospital day number nine , BUN was 22 , creatinine was 3.5 .
A Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine .
Subsequently , the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day .
Blood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 .
The patient &apos;s fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 .
The patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 .
Gradually over the course of the following days , the patient &apos;s electrolytes again normalized ; however , as the patient continues to take p.o.&apos; s poorly , the patient remained on IV hydration therapy .
On hospital day number fourteen , electrolytes were sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 .
If the patient &apos;s p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day , the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour .
Periodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection .
It should be noted that while in the hospital , the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
MENTAL STATUS CHANGES .
1) AORTIC STENOSIS .
2) MITRAL REGURGITATION .
5) RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY WOUND .
The patient is an 88 year-old woman undergoing treatment for a right lower extremity cellulitis who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Child</PHI> for worsening cellulitis and new confusion .
The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and was recently admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for a Nafcillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis of the right leg treated with a course of Nafcillin and Levofloxacin .
There was also a right leg fluid collection that was incised and drained on <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 1</PHI> , 1998 .
The patient was sent to rehabilitation on Levofloxacin orally .
Although details were not available at the time of admission , apparently , she had done well until the 24 hours proceeding admission when the cellulitis was felt to be worsening .
She had also been noted to be confused and combative during that 24 hour period .
As her baseline mental status is completely alert and oriented , this caused concern amongst the staff of the rehabilitation center and the patient was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> .
1) Aortic stenosis , severe , echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of 1998 with a peak gradient of 6-8 mm of mercury , aortic valve area calculated to be 0.5 cm squared by the continuity equation .
The patient has a history of congestive heart failure .
3) History of atrial fibrillation .
4) History of cerebrovascular disease .
5) Hypertension .
6) History of temporal arteritis on chronic steroids .
7) History of colitis .
8) History of vertebral body fractures .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :

Vital signs :
Heart rate 60 , respiratory rate 18 , blood pressure 116/80 , temperature 97.1 degrees , oxygen saturation 93% on room air .
Head and neck examination was benign .
Skin examination was notable for a leg ulcer and cellulitis to be delineated below .
Neck was supple with no thyromegaly .
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained PMI which was located in the left mid clavicular line , S1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .
It radiates to both carotids bilaterally .
There was also a blowing holosystolic murmur heard at the patient &apos;s apex to axilla .
There was no S3 appreciated .
Abdominal examination revealed that the abdomen was soft , non-tender , non-distended , no organomegaly , no masses , normal active bowel sounds .
The patient &apos;s extremity examination was notable for erythema of the right calf with a small ulcer with a relatively clean base .
Neurological examination revealed that the patient was quite sedated at this time having received some medications .
Her pupils were reactive bilaterally .
Her face was symmetric .
She had an intact gag reflex .
She was able to move all four of her extremities in response to pain .

LABORATORY :
The patient &apos;s laboratory data on admission is as follows :
AST was 25 , alkaline phosphatase 130 , total bilirubin 3.2 , albumin 3.4 , calcium 8.8 .
Digoxin level was 0.8 .
Coagulation studies revealed a PT of 17.4 seconds with an INR of 2.1 , PTT 25.5 .
The patient &apos;s admission chest x-ray revealed no infiltrate , no congestive heart failure .
Head CT scan performed in the emergency department revealed no bleed .
Urinalysis revealed trace microscopic hematuria with 47 red blood cells per high powered field , 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Mental status changes :
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .

A heterotopic kidney transplant , placed in the left pelvic fossa and native left nephrectomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-29</PHI>-94 .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
1. colonoscopy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-5</PHI>-94 ,
4. renal biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-13</PHI>-94 .
He started on dialysis in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/92 and has been maintained on it since .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post left arteriovenous fistula creation .
1. hypertension ,
2. difficulty hearing ,
4. history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , two prior episodes .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was negative .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was unremarkable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
During this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .
The patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .
He was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
The patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated .
A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction .
Again , he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .
He did have some postoperative hypertension which was controlled with Cardura and sublingual nifedipine prn .
Prednisone 20 mg PO q.day , Imuran 25 mg PO q.day , Acyclovir 200 mg PO t.i.d. , Bactrim one single strength PO qhs , Maalox 15 cc PO b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Verapamil 80 mg PO t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg PO b.i.d. , Cardura 4 mg PO b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 300 mg PO b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg PO q.day , Clotrimazole 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Inderal 10 mg PO t.i.d.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gastric ulcer and gastric pericardial fistula , constricting pericarditis , adult respiratory distress syndrome , status post gunshot wounds and paraplegia since 1991 of T4 on down .
He has multiple decubiti on his buttocks and penis .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Albuterol inhaler .
Amphotericin B 40 mg. qday .
Ceftazidime 1 gram intravenous q 8 .
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg. po. q12 .
Cisapride 10 mg. po. qid .
Dakin &apos;s solution 1/4 strength to ulcer of penis .
Benadryl 50 mg. intravenous tid prn .
Lasix prn .
Nystatin swish and swallow tid .
Percocet po. q4 to 6 prn .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a pericardial window .
He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
It was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath .
The family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
1. Neurologic and Psychologic :
Otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities .
The patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease .
2. Cardiac :
He had a cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 1</PHI> , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials .

CAUSE OF DEATH :
MULTISYSTEM ORGAN FAILURE .
TIME OF DEATH :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> is a 59-year-old gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , alcoholic cirrhosis , and rectal cancer , who was scheduled for a resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the Medicine team for improvement of his heart failure .
He has mitral regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and an aortic valve area of 1.1 cm. squared with a peak gradient of 36 to 54 .
He was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon following an episode of bright red blood per rectum and 3.5-cm. sessile lesion at 27 cm. , which was biopsied through a colonoscopy , which revealed adenocarcinoma .
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% .
Atrial fibrillation since 1990 .
Recurrent urinary tract infections .
Mitral valve regurgitation of 4+ .
Tricuspid regurgitation .
Aortic stenosis .
Cellulitis and sepsis in 1992 .
Hyponatremia .
Peripheral vascular disease .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Lasix 40 mg. b.i.d. Tagamet 400 mg. b.i.d. Lisinopril 10 mg. q. day .
Digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day .
ALLERGIES :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His temperature was 99 .
Heart rate was 110 .
He had jugular venous distention to the level of the jaw in the upright position .
His heart rate was irregularly with a 2/6 holosystolic murmur .
His chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one-halfway up the chest .
His abdomen was soft and nontender with a positive fluid wave and a liver edge 3 cm. below the costal margin .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the Medicine Service and diuresed with Lasix and started on Captopril with the Lisinopril discontinued .
After aggressive diuresis on the Medical Service , he was deemed stable for surgery .
After many discussions between Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leickgrend</PHI> , the patient , and his family , concerning the severely high risk , given the patient &apos;s conditions , it was decided to proceed with the operation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/27</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .
His fluids were very strongly restricted , and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the Operating Room with 400 cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated .
He was taken to the Post-Surgical Intensive Care Unit , intubated and stable .
He was finally extubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/10</PHI>/95 , and despite respiratory rates in the 30s and very coarse , rhonchorous breath sounds , the patient continued to have acceptable oxygen saturation and acceptable blood gases on minimal oxygen .
He required some fluid boluses with D-5-W to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/14</PHI>/95 , he returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for very aggressive pulmonary toilet .
His portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm. , going from 26 to 23 , so no shunt was placed .
At that time , multiple discussions were held with the family , and they decided to enact a Do Not Resuscitate order .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> &apos;s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine .
His urine output remained very low .
His white blood cell count rose to 22,000 with a 50% bandemia .
Throughout the day on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/18</PHI>/95 , his blood pressure continued to fall in the 80s , then 70s , then 60s , and at 3:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/19</PHI>/95 , despite multiple pressors , his blood pressure dropped down to 50 ; he then went into ventricular fibrillation , followed by flat line .
At that time , he had no spontaneous respirations and no audible heart tones .
He had no carotid pulses , no gag reflex , and no pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .
The family was contacted and were present at his bedside .
A postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family .

UNIT NUMBER :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">07/12</PHI>/2004
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">07/29</PHI>/2004
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Secondary neoplasm of bone ( extensive ) .
3. Delirium ( adverse affects of opiates ) .
4. Depression .
6. Anemia of chronic disease .
7. Hypercalcemia .
8. History of perforated gastric ulcer treated with hemigastrectomy <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/2004 .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Radiation therapy to the right clavicle <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/16</PHI>/2004 .
One of several <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">PUOMC</PHI> admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .
She had actually completed her five years of Tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch .
Not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement .
She ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain .
There had been no focal neurologic changes .
Up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease .
On admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on room air was 92% .
She had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement .
She was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .
Sodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 .
Bilirubin normal .
Her alk phos slightly up at 174 .
WBC 10.8 with normal differential .
A urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells .
She gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle .
She also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral MRIs to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression .
She had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of Physical Therapy .
Her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .
Escalate the doses of the Dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o&apos;clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on Remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional SSRI overlap until it seems to show more affect .
She lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .
The patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .
She was begun on Letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of Xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">First</PHI> &apos;s office to have further discussions of this later approach .
Zofran 8 mg p.o. q.8 p.r.n. nausea .
Doculax 5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n. Colace 100 mg b.i.d. Senna syrup two teaspoonfuls b.i.d. Mylanta 15-30 mg p.r.n. dyspepsia .
Multivitamin , Megace 200 mg p.o. q.d. ( appetite stimulant ) .
Nexium 20 mg q.d. Femora ( letrazole ) 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. Polyethylene glycol ( Miralax ) 17 gm p.o. q.d. Dilaudid 4 mg p.o. q.4 hours p.r.n. breakthrough pain .
Dexedrine 5 mg p.o. at 8 a.m.
The patient was discharged in improved , stable , satisfactory condition with the expectation that she will call Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">First</PHI> &apos;s office for a followup visit in about two weeks .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION , PULMONARY LYMPHANGITIC SPREAD , AND LIVER AND SPLEEN METASTASES .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
She was evaluated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mielke</PHI> , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .
She was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Weekscook University Medical Center</PHI> with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.
Temperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .
HEENT :
Dry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .
NECK :
No lymphadenopathy .
Regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .
ABDOMEN :
Well healed Pfannenstiel scars and no masses .
PELVIC :
No masses .
RECTAL :
No masses and guaiac negative .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .
PT and PTT were 12 and 26 .
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was no evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/14</PHI> and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/11</PHI> .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/19</PHI> , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/20</PHI> .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/19</PHI> and Ifex and Mesna on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> .
She was noted , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/16</PHI> , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .
She was hooked up with support services in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961</PHI> for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/22</PHI>/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mielke</PHI> and home care services .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Premarin 0.625 q.d. , Proventil Inhaler two puffs q.i.d. , Beclovent four puffs b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , MS Contin 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Trilisate 750 mg p.o. b.i.d. , MS Elixir 100 mg p.o. q.2h. p.r.n. , Robitussin with Codeine 5 cc p.o. q.2h. , and home O2 two liters via nasal prong with increase to four liters as needed for symptoms p.r.n.

Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Po</PHI> is a 53 year-old white male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who is admitted with a 10-day history of progressive dyspnea on exertion .
Briefly , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Po</PHI> presented in 1992 with dysphagia and a midesophageal mass that proved to be squamous cell carcinoma .
He received two cycles of neoadjuvant Cisplatin and 5-FU , followed by esophagectomy , followed by two cycles of adjuvant platinum/5-FU .
He was without evidence of disease until the <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of 1994 , when he developed an inferior vena cava thrombosis and CT scan revealed celiac axis adenopathy .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1994 , pulmonary disease , consistent with lymphangetic spread of tumor , was present .
He began Ifosfamide chemotherapy but in the last few cycles has had progressive disease .
Over the last 10 days , he has been bothered by progressive dyspnea on exertion .
He denies fevers , chills , hemoptysis , chest pain , nausea and vomiting , or diarrhea .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
2) Inferior vena cava occlusion .
3) Arthritis .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Skin is pale .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam reveals mild proptosis .
He has total alopecia .
His neck is supple .
The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
PT was 19.8 seconds .
The patient was admitted with a diagnostic impression of probable progressive carcinoma with a potential component of bronchospasm .
However , there was the possibility that this represented an atypical pulmonary infection .
Hence , he went to bronchoscopy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jesclinke</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/22</PHI>/95 .
Bronchoscopy revealed clear airways without evidence of significant secretions .
BAL was sent for culture and was negative for pathogenic organisms .
It was felt that there were no further chemotherapy options for this disease and he met with hospice therapy .
In addition , he was hypoxic throughout his admission , often with oxygen saturations in the high 80s despite five liters of supplemental oxygen .
This was accompanied with some anxiety , which was treated with intermittent morphine and Ativan .
The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Mar 30</PHI> , 1995 with hospice care .
His status is DNR .
Tagamet , 800 mg. PO q.day ; five liters of supplemental oxygen ; Carafate , 1 gm. b.i.d. ; Ativan , 1 mg. SL q.4 p.r.n.

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Granrivern Call</PHI> is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
He was later seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Flo Cuchkote</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
Over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Coumadin 4 mgs po qhs , Vasotec 5 mgs po qd , Lasix prn , Digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , Proscar and Sinemet .
ALLERGIES :
1) atrial fibrillation on coumadin ,
2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in World War II .
3) Question progressive supranuclear palsy .
4) old right frontal infarct .
Tobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use .
Alcohol ; he has no recent use .
He was a previous drinker of one &quot; old fashioned &quot; every night .
He has a father who had dementia .
There was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .
He was afebrile .
In general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .
head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .
His neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits .
oropharynx was intubated with blood as well .
Cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
Abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds .
no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .
He does not regard the examiner .
He had no blink to threat .
According to the family this iansicoria was old .
He had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally .
He had no gag to tube manipulation .
Motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .
He triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain .
His deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 .
His toes were down going .
chest x-ray clear .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 18</PHI> , 1996 .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 19</PHI> , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ria</PHI> in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Heart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 .
General :
This is a pleasant 60 year-old man whose distressed .
HEENT , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed right jaw incision , slight swelling right jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is no erythema .
Lungs are clear to auscultation .
Heart regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Neurological alert and oriented times three , speech is fluent although there is some difficulty of tongue movement .
Cranial nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right .
Strength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jan 22</PHI> , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .
He was extubated on postoperative day number one .
His neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .
He was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .
On postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .
A head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .
A culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .
A video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .
Because of continuing complaints by Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .
Prior to admission Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .
After conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .
His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .
His lumbar drain was removed after five days .
He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .
He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .
He will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .
FOLLOW-UP :
Follow-up will be with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Sick</PHI> in one weeks time .
He will needed a follow-up CT or MRI for the pseudomeningocele .
ADDENDUM
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> will be restarted on his preoperative Aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days .

DEATH SUMMARY
The patient was a 61-year-old white man with a history of mediastinal lymphoma who was admitted for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
The patient was diagnosed with lymphoma in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> of 1988 when a biopsy of her left cervical node revealed T cell versus Hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma .
He underwent intensive chemotherapy and entered a complete remission .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/89 , he developed B symptoms and work-up revealed relapse in the mediastinum , retroperitoneum , and bone marrow .
He underwent salvage chemotherapy and again went into remission .
He was then admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/20</PHI>/90 for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Right mastectomy for benign lesion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His physical examination was noteable only for the following .
His lungs were clear .
Abdomen was benign .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed a normal SMA-7 except for potassium of 3.1 .
His liver function tests showed a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 139 but was otherwise normal .
Hematocrit was 29.3 .
White blood cell count was 4.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Fever and neutropenia :
He was treated with multiple antibiotics including ceftazidime , gentamicin , vancomycin and ampho .
Despite this , the fevers persisted until he no longer was neutropenic .
2. Renal occlusive disease :
Multiple abdominal ultrasound revealed no biliary dilatation ; there was evidence of gallbladder polyps versus stones on one ultrasound .
Towards the end of the hospitalization , his bilirubins were in the high 30&apos;s and low 40&apos;s .
3. Renal failure :
Despite aggressive attempts to maintain his intravascular volume , the patient &apos;s renal function progressively declined .
He received multiple transfusions with coloids , including red blood cells and albumin .
Despite a very aggressive approach to his care , the patient continued to decline .
Therefore , in close discussion with the family , he was made DNR .
The patient &apos;s clinical situation continued to deteriorate and he died on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/9</PHI>/90 at 4:30 a.m.
An autopsy was refused .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/16</PHI>/98
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Right nephrectomy .
4. Transplant nephrectomy .
5. Pulmonary emboli .
8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
10. Perforated viscus .
11. Abdominal abscesses .
12. Sepsis .
13. Respiratory failure .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/16</PHI>/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .
A pulmonary arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/03</PHI>/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/19</PHI>/97 .
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/06</PHI>/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .
The patient remained unstable .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/08</PHI>/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Less</PHI> continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Less</PHI> condition was irretrievable .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Cantsleddjesc</PHI> felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .

The patient underwent TAH / BSO , partial omentectomy at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CTMC</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>-90 .
Pathology showed grade II-III papillary adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with squamous differentiation which was focally invasive and superficial myometrium .
The ovary showed papillary serous adeno with omental involvement consistent with an endometroid adenocarcinoma .
The question was whether or not whether she had two primaries vs metastatic endometrial cancer .
The patient underwent 6 cycles of CAP in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Pemrancetul Tonsst.</PHI> .
However , during the fourth cycle , Cytoxan was dropped .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>-92 , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Wellla Uxinny:mount Medical Center</PHI> with left leg DVT and started on Heparin therapy .
She was discharged from there on Coumadin therapy .
Negative except as above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Coumadin 5 mg po q d , Tagamet 400 mg po q d , Amoxicillin which was started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Labor Day</PHI> , for a sore throat and Ativan 1 mg po prn nausea / anxiety .
ALLERGIES :
The patient gets hives to aspirin and tomatoes also cause her hives .
The temp was 99.4 , BP 114/78 , pulse 128 and respirations 20 .
She was an anxious female , in no acute distress .
The lungs were clear to auscultation .
CV was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , positive bowel sounds , non tender , large , hard mass occupying the lower abdomen and left upper quadrant .
The extremities were non tender without edema .
She had CA-125 which was pending at the time of discharge .
Her hematocrit was 31.1 , WBC 11.6 and 151,000 platelets .
PLAN :
The patient is thus stage IV endometrial and stage III-C ovarian vs metastatic endometrial for line II , cycle I chemotherapy IFEX , MESNA and VP-16 .

With the history of DVT , we plan Coumadin and check her coags .
The patient was tachycardiac on admission and it was felt she was dehydrated and / or anxious at the time of her initial evaluation .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia and incomplete right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
IFEX 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days , MESNA 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days continuous IV infusion .
She had VP-16 mixed with 250 cc IV fluid given over 1 hour each day for 3 days .
She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient &apos;s urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
She did receive her VP-16 without complication .
Other significant issues were the patient &apos;s hematocrit on admission at 31.1 which dwindled down to 26.2 by <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-10</PHI> .
However , the patient &apos;s hematocrit bumped only to 28.1 and a repeat later on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-11</PHI> , showed hematocrit of 27.6 .
At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit on the day of discharge was 35.6 showing significant bump in her count after her second two units of packed RBC&apos;s .
Her PT on the day of discharge was 13.2 and she was started on Coumadin 2.5 mg po q d as mentioned .
FOLLOW UP CARE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-28</PHI>-92 , the patient will return for chemotherapy and she will follow up with her primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jescspald</PHI> , for repeat PT and Coumadin dosing on Monday , <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-14</PHI>-02 .

After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He had good hemodynamics .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/05</PHI> it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .
He had a right bundle branch block .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew</PHI> .

None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Vessels</PHI> is a 49-year-old man status post orthotopic heart transplantation in 1991 at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dautenorwe Stuart Erec Hillpa Of Hospital</PHI> who is admitted with dyspnea and severe heart failure .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Vessels</PHI> &apos;s postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so .
Recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis .
A repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease .
A biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils .
He was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil .
Chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly .
Prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Examination revealed a tired , fatigued man with cool extremities .
Carotids were 2+ .
Crackles were increased 1/4 of the way up .
There was a left ventricular heave and an S3 galop .
The abdomen was soft and nontender with a palpable liver edge and the pulses were diminished .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram revealed poor R wave progression and marked decrease in all volts .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed .
The echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction .
Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy .
The patient diuresed and responded to Lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed .
Despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated .
There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions .
A pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid .
A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure .
The resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 AM and were begun at 3:38 AM .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
STATUS POST MULTIPLE EMBOLISMS AND LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBUS PROCEDURES :
LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBECTOMY .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 63 year old patient who had no significant medical history until 1987 , when he developed a left arm embolism which was treated with SVG from the left thigh .
The postop course was uncomplicated with an embolus occluding the graft and a CVA .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">04</PHI>-90 , the patient suffered an intestinal embolism requiring an ileostomy which was closed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>-90 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>-90 , the patient developed a second CVA presenting with slurred speech which resolved without residual .
The patient also reports that he had a large silent MI in <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>-89 , which was uncomplicated .
After admission to the Medical Service , the patient underwent work up for embolism source and source for his dizziness .
A recent echo showed 1+ MR , inferior apical and left ventricular akinesis and a 3 x 2.5 cm spherical mass in the inferior apical left ventricle .
This finding was in concurrence with findings of a cardiac cath performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-12</PHI>-92 .
Coronary angiography during the cardiac cath had revealed normal coronaries without coronary artery disease .
After the usual preparation , the patient was taken to the OR on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-14</PHI>-92 , and underwent left ventriculotomy and removal of the left ventricular thrombus .
The pathological examination of the removed material revealed a blood clot with thrombus .
During the early postop period , he was kept on IV Dextran and was restarted on Coumadin .
His further postop course was complicated by a recurrent episode of dizziness .
His neurologic work up , however , was negative .
A repeat echo showed no recurrent intraventricular thrombus and a carotid Doppler study was negative .
He was discharged in good condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-22</PHI>-92 .
Synthroid .1 mg po q d , Metamucil one pack po q d , Persantine 50 mg po t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d. , Anusol cream at anal t.i.d. , Coumadin for PTT equal 20 seconds as directed , Albuterol inhaler two puffs q 6 h prn .
FOLLOW UP CARE :
Since our Hematology consultant recommended to keep the patient &apos;s PT in the range of 20-22 seconds , the patient will require close follow up of his PT&apos;s while on Coumadin .
He has an appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">O Kotea</PHI> for his cardiac surgical follow up 4 weeks post discharge .

The patient is a 71-year-old right-handed white female with a history of confusion and difficulty with speech for about one year .
A CAT scan done at that time , of the head , showed tumor in the left frontal region .
The patient received radiation therapy and the tumor resolved completely on the CAT scan .
The patient did well until <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 1991 , when a followup CAT scan showed hydrocephalus and symptoms were increasing , of sleep , but she also had a high phenobarbital level .
A lumbar puncture was done ; results are unknown , but with a decrease in her pheno-barbital level she did well .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> the tumor regrew and the patient received interferon and BCNU therapy until <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> .
This was limited by her decreasing blood counts .
CAT scan prior to <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/29</PHI> , the tumor showed shrinkage of about 80% but increasing hydrocephalus .
The lumbar puncture was ineffective for the treatment of the hydrocephalus .
The patient progressed to be more sleepy , her language was more sparse , she was more confused and weak , and incontinent .
She recurred with some seizures , and underwent admission this time for evaluation for a ventriculo-peritoneal VP shunt placement for the hydrocephalus .
The patient had kidney stone removed , and the pacemaker as above .

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was brought to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 21</PHI> , 1997 , where he underwent a flexible bronchoscopy , left lower lobectomy .
postoperatively , the patient went to the respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
Cardiology wise , electrocardiogram revealed no right bundle branch block although no ischemia and he was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin .
The patient had difficulty with chest tubes and air leak and a small pneumothorax .
This subsequently improved .
He was off oxygen , although he had some dyspnea with ambulation .
He was subsequently noted to have a large air leak , but was intrapleural .
This was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 7</PHI> , 1997 .
He was transfused for a hematocrit of 27 and then admitted back to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 25</PHI> .
The patient was bronchoscoped for several times for junky left lung fields .
He did require Albumin and continued with intravenous fluids .
Pain was well controlled with an epidural catheter .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 14</PHI> , 1997 , the patient was transferred to the RICU for respiratory compromise with rapid atrial fibrillation possibly due to aspiration .
He was followed closely by infectious disease .
He was also started on total parenteral nutrition supplementation .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stire</PHI> then became lethargic and decompensated neurologically .
He continued to decompensate neurologically given his new right Babinski , and increased deep tendon reflexes on the right .
In the interim he did have a esophagogastroduodenoscopy and placement of post pyloric feeding tube for nutritional supplement .
He was seen by neuro house staff and was felt to have worsening encephalopathy and this suspicion was secondary to brain metastases .
He was started on Dilantin .
The patient did have several episodes of grand mal seizures and his Dilantin was adjusted to therapeutic doses .
Additional issue was an increase in BUN and creatinine .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 19</PHI> , 1997 , he went back to the operating room for a tracheostomy .

She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .
Patient also received AICD .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
Patient &apos;s past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
In 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Hispit , Delaware</PHI> .
Since that time the patient has been treated medically .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">07</PHI>/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> .
Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Coronaries were completely normal .
In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .
Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .
Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .
Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
Furthermore , due to the patient &apos;s long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .
The patient did well at home until <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/31</PHI>/94 when she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Souland</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nixmont Bovo</PHI> with increasing congestive heart failure .
By report , in the interim since discharge from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .
She was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20</PHI>/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Alllo Eino Hospital</PHI> which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient &apos;s arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/22</PHI>/94 an EPS study was performed .
The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .
Consequently AICD placement was recommended .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 .
Note , from <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/22</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI> there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .
Consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .
Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Thus , AICD placement was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
At this point it was felt the patient would go home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/94 .
It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Vonamemp , LA</PHI> via plane by herself .
This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .
Type II diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps .
ALLERGIES :

EXTREMITIES :
NEUROLOGICAL :
Nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Digoxin 0.9 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
As mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation .
As per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate .
Hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to AICD placement .
Note , for the question of the right forearm thrombophlebitis , the right forearm was debrided and sent for culture and pathology .
Cultures were negative .
Debridement was negative for purulent discharge .
The patient did well following the AICD placement .
There were no intraoperative complications , and no postoperative complications .

UNIT NUMBER :
<PHI TYPE="ID">083-97-79</PHI>
ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">09/15</PHI>/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Wolfe-Parkinson White Syndrome .
Atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
His cardiac risk factors include :
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of chest pain and in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .
He subsequently had an echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .
He subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .
He was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .
He underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Slusslashgodle</PHI> which were unsuccessful .
He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
He was discharged home but returned on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/13</PHI>/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .
He denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .
Sotalol 160 mg bid .
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
NPH and CZI insulin .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
Lisinopril 10 mg bid .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
There was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
His lungs were clear throughout .
His apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .
His abdomen was benign .
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .
His creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .
His electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .
There were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .
Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .
His initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .
He was seen by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nnoatal Hospital Center</PHI> who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .
Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/17</PHI>/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .
His right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .
His left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .
The patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/20</PHI>/98 .
There was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .
Mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .
Radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .
There were no complications .
Following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .
There were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .
He also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .
Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .
After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .
Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .
Accordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .
He did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/23</PHI>/98 .
He will have a visiting nurse to see him on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Iat</PHI> .
FOLLOW-UP :
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Sotalol 120 mg bid .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
Ecotrin 1 qd ( on hold until off of Coumadin ) .

She was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .
She denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .
She was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .
There was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .
Apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ez Ephtro Health Center</PHI> where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter , however , works at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> and therefore the family elected to bring the patient home and then bring her to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> .
She did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .
ENT consult was obtained .
A lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
ENT examination was then to be performed .
Chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
None .
ALLERGIES :
Smoking none .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
Alcohol none .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
She had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
Oral cavity was normal .
Revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass .
Neck :
Hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
The left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
The epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .
The patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .
Lungs :
Clear .
Heart :
Regular rate and rhythm .
S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .
No masses .
Normal .
Back :
Revealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .
As noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
The chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
Due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .
The patient was sedated .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .
EKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .
She continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .
Her blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .
She was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .
She continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .
Her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/3</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/4</PHI> revealed decreasing edema .
She was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .
Examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .
Otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .
Of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .
Once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .
Again , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
O2 saturations looked good .
She was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .
She was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .
Her white counts came down .
Blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .
Cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/9</PHI>/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .
Our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .
She , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
If she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .
Discharge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .
The patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .

Report Status :
ADMISSION DATE :
DISCHARGE DATE :
Cholangiocarcinoma , recurrent ; status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
2) Subhepatic fluid collection , drained .
3) Clostridium difficile colitis with diarrhea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , replacement of permanent biliary stents and liver biopsy .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/24</PHI>/95 , percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 55-year-old man who is status post resection of a Klatskin tumor , who returns with persistent jaundice and right upper quadrant pain .
The present illness is marked by presentation with jaundice and pain in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 1994 , and a computerized tomography scan that showed bile duct dilatation .
The surgical margins were positive and he was treated postoperatively with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
Biopsies and fine needle aspirates were suspicious for recurrent cholangiocarcinoma .
Since that time he had been persistently jaundiced and fatigued , until three weeks prior to admission when the patient had a biliary tube check , which showed things to be patent despite his rising bilirubin .
His lungs were clear .
His head and neck showed marked scleral icterus and a cardiac examination showed a systolic ejection murmur .
The abdomen was soft and had well healed right upper quadrant scar .
Rectal examination was negative and his neurological examination was intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
His hematocrit was 25.8% , with a normal white blood cell count .
His bilirubin was total 11.1 , with a direct bilirubin of 10.2 and his alkaline phosphatase was 2,188 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The computerized tomography scan showed dilated left and right hepatic ducts and was consistent with some form of blockage of the drainage arrangement .
The procedures took place on several days throughout the hospital stay with the sentinel pro cedure taking place on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , and this was placement of the 10 mm diameter metal wallstents .
Subsequent to that , he was found to have a subhepatic fluid collection , which was suspicious for a bile leak and therefore a drain was placed percutaneously into this collection .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/95 and <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , very mild revisions were made of these and the feeling was that solution had been reached with good drainage .
His bilirubin by the time of discharge had fallen from a peak of 28 down to a discharge value of 8 .
During the course of the hospitalization , he was found to have diarrhea and stool was sent and found to be positive for Clostridium difficile toxin and this initiated treatment with Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for two weeks .
He was covered prophylactically for the indwelling stents with ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , it was deemed he was ready for discharge and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Blinjesc</PHI> discharged him to the care of his primary physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ma</PHI> , in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Taette</PHI> .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ma</PHI> will be working with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Besti Kotebreun</PHI> of <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> to manage the currently indwelling stents .
The patient will continue his course of Flagyl until that is finished and he will stay on the po ofloxacin until the external draining stents are removed .

DISCHARGE DATE :
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
The patient is a 74 year old right hand dominant white female with a history of primary central nervous system lymphoma , diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1994 , status post twelve cycles of high dose methotrexate , status post two cycles of high dose ARA-C chemotherapy , who was admitted with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and decreasing platelet count .
An MRI showed enhancing white marrow lesions at the bifrontal lobes on the right side , and rightsided basal ganglion in the right cerebral peduncle .
The patient underwent a biopsy which showed a primary CNS lymphoma .
The patient was initially treated with high-dose methotrexate for six cycles .
However , when the patient was started on 3.5 gm / meter sq. maintenance dose , the tumor progressed .
On the high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy , the patient developed bone marrow suppression requiring intermittent Neupogen ( GCSF ) support .
On the day of admission the patient &apos;s platelet count dropped to 28,000 and the patient was admitted for her platelet transfusions and further work up for her rectal bleeding .
The patient complained of chronic constipation and rectal bleeding after each bowel movement .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/25</PHI>/95 :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 26</PHI> , white blood count 2.5 , hematocrit 29 , platelet count 32,000 .
66 polys , 8 bands with ANC of 1056 .
Sodium 136 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 103 , bicarb 26 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
An electrocardiogram showed flat ST change in lead III , otherwise unremarkable and the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin without symptomatic improvement .
The patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 76,000 on the following morning ; however , her white blood count dropped to 900 with 58 polys with 8 bands .
Because of significant neutropenia , the patient was put on reverse isolation and started on GCSF injections .
The patient &apos;s white blood count improved with the GCSF and her counts went up to 18.2 on the day of discharge .
After the transfusion the patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 101,000 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 2</PHI> .
However , in lieu of a persistent bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy , it was decided that she should undergo radiation therapy .
The patient was assimilated on the day of discharge and the patient will be started on radiation therapy in a few days .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will have a follow up complete blood count with differential on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI>

The patient was a 68 year old female who presented to the emergency room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/22</PHI> with a chief complaint of increasing dyspnea .
She had a long history of smoking and fairly severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She eventually ruled in for a myocardial infarction and was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/21</PHI> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , she was an elderly female in moderate respiratory distress , blood pressure 100/60 , respirations 26 , pulse 68 , temperature afebrile .
S1 and S2 were markedly diminished .
Breath sounds were markedly diminished on the right ; crackles were present on the left , approximately 1/3 up .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds present and no pulsatile masses evident .
There was 2+ lower extremity edema evident .
No grossly evident focal neurological findings were noted .
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Crestwall Hospital</PHI> , where a therapeutic thoracentesis was performed in order to alleviate her dyspnea .
Cytology was positive for moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma .
A chest CT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/24</PHI> demonstrated a right lower lobe mass as well as significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy .
A cardiac ultrasound study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Memorial Day</PHI> demonstrated an aortic stenosis with a calculated valve area of .6 square cm .
Following an episode of mild rightsided weakness associated with slurring of speech on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/06</PHI> , a brain MRI was obtained .
An enhancing focus in the left thalamus was thought to represent a subacute infarct .
In addition an old cerebellar focal infarct was noted , although metastasis could not be completely excluded .
During the course of the last 4-5 days the patient &apos;s condition deteriorated substantially .
After extensive consultation with her family and with the patient herself , it was decided that her status should be made DNR .
This was completely consonant with her wishes and her family &apos;s wishes as well .
Over the weekend of <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/30</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/01</PHI> , her condition further deteriorated , and she was started on a morphine drip .
She did not respond to intravenous diuretics or renal dose dopamine .
We insured that she was comfortable until she expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/02</PHI>/94 .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">04-09</PHI>-94
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cean Leach</PHI> is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ville , Virginia</PHI> for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .
He was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l988 .
A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .
His ejection fraction was in the mid-50&apos;s.
He did well until he developed recurrent angina in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .
He again did well until approximately late l992 .
Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with recurrent chest pain .
He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .
He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40&apos;s and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l994 at 31% .
He was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with a typical episode of this discomfort in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
He was transferred at that time to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
That was his first <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> admission .
Because of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .
His angiograms from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .
He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 13</PHI> , 1994 .
There he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .
Specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .
Following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .
However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .
It was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .
He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .
Following that admission in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .
Starting in the <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .
He had multiple admissions to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .
His medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .
He had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .
Because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-9</PHI>-94 .
Of note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
There is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .
Of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .
His medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He looked generally well .
His blood pressure l60/90 .
His heart rate was 88 .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
His femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .
He had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
Potassium of 3.2 .
Normal chloride and CO2 .
His BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .
His fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .
His liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-10</PHI>-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .
The right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .
Coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
That is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .
Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .
Impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .
He was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lato Tikfreierm</PHI> of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .
This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s regiment .
Repeat in vitro testing of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .
While in the hospital , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .
These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .
There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .
Multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .
He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .
Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Protein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .
Factor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .
Thrombin time and repalase time were normal .
It was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .
He was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .
His compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .
To evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .
Prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 13</PHI> .
On the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .
He was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .
Once again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .
The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .
After extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .
He tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .
He had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 27</PHI> , 1995 .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">02/28</PHI>/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Thoracoabdominal aneurysm .
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm .
HISTORY :
The patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/18</PHI>/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Eifro Medical Center</PHI> which was evaluated with a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan .
At that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .
The patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .
Since the patient &apos;s last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress .
Her head and neck examination is within normal limits .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
She has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass .
Extremities :
She has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .
Neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Her chest X-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
There were no intraoperative complications .
On postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .
Epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .
She was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .
This was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .
Laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels .
Neurological consultation was obtained .
It was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .
The epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .
MRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .
The patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .
Continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .
Her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .
Social Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .
The patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .
Additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center</PHI> .
It is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
(1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection .
COMPLICATIONS :
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riode Zetllille</PHI> and she is to maintain rehabilitation care at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Laelk Memorial Hospital</PHI> .

After the syncopal episode the patient was evaluated at a local hospital with head and abdominal CT , EEG , and EKG , all of which were normal .
Her Flecainide was discontinued and she was referred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CTMC</PHI> for further evaluation .
Following discontinuation of this drug the patient noted return of palpitations .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Left mastectomy in 1982 for breast carcinoma .
History of upper GI bleeding in 1985 while on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines .
DJD , hypertension , status post cholecystectomy , status post cataract surgery , status post herniorrhaphy .
None known .
Vaseretic 10 mg p.o.q.d. , Calan SR 240 mg p.o.q.d. , Motrin 600 mg p.o. prn , Cytotec prn with Motrin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
Pleasant elderly lady in no apparent distress .
Blood pressure 140/70 , heart rate 84 , with occasional premature beats , respirations 16 , afebrile .
Showed bruises over both her knees .
HEENT :
Neck :
Supple without lympadenopathy .
No JVD .
Lungs :
COR :
Showed no JVD .
Normal S1 and S2 without murmurs .
Digital pulses were absent bilaterally .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , without masses .
CNS :
Alert and oriented .
Cranial nerves intact .
Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout .
Extremities :
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit 44 , WBC count 4.9 thousand , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 thousand , potassium 3.6 , PT and PTT were within normal limits .
LFTs were normal .
Cholesterol 252 .
Chest x-ray normal .
UA was normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a history of syncope for cardiac evaluation .
She was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where a catheterization revealed an 80% mid-RCA stenosis , 80% mid-LAD lesion and an LVEF of approximately 80% .
It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient &apos;s episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress .
On the following day , she was taken to electrophysiologic study .
During the study , the right bundle branch was hit by the catheter , inducing a right bundle branch block .
Following this , upon rapid atrial pacing at a rate of 120 , there was revealed a bifascicular left block , which combined with the right bundle branch block caused a complete heart block .
It was felt that given this rate-related block on the left , combined with the possibility of physiologic malfunction on the right , complete heart block as the source of the patient &apos;s syncopal episode was quite possible and plans were made to insert a VVI pacer .
The pacer was inserted on the fifth hospital day without event , and the patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day .
Calan SR 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Vaseretic 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ibuprofen and Cytotec prn joint pain .
The patient is discharged home .
Discharge condition good .

1. Obstructive jaundice .
3. biliary obstruction .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/05</PHI>/94 .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/93 , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/24</PHI> she was taken to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Rys Memorial Hospital</PHI> hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and admitted there from <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/25</PHI> - <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/03</PHI> .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .

Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/05</PHI> an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
The General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/08</PHI> a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
The patient &apos;s subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
