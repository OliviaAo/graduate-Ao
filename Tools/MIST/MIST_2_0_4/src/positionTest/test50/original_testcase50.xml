Four months prior to admission , she had occasional band like chest pain across her entire chest .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> of 1989 , she was begun on 5-FU for five days of treatment followed by three weeks of no treatment .
Two weeks prior to admission , she had a presyncopal episode but did not lose consciousness .
There were no other symptoms .
One day prior to admission , she was seen at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dagreat Health</PHI> for 5-FU , her third cycle .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Include smoking and increased cholesterol .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes (1) pancreatic cancer , status post a Whipple procedure , on 5-FU .
(2) Status post a cholecystectomy , appendectomy , and hysterectomy .
(3) Fibrocystic breast disease .
Include 5-FU and Percocet for pain , Zantac , and Simethicone .

PAST HISTORY :
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with &quot; marginal PFTs &quot; ; alcohol abuse ; skin graft after a parachute failed to open .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Unclear .
Blood pressure 86/62 ; pulse 124 ; respiratory rate 24 .
The cardiac exam revealed tachycardia and very distant sounds .
A Swan showed a PA of 40/21 , a wedge of 17 , cardiac output 3.8 and index 2.3 .
He was on 2 mcg of dopamine .
His circumflex had a 60% obstruction prior to the obtuse marginal branch with a 60% stenosis of the obtuse marginal branch .
The obtuse marginal second branch was subtotally occluded .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
It was considered that too much time had elapsed since his infarction and nothing was to be gained by revascularizing this infarct zone .
He was then stabilized medically in preparation for surgery .
The left internal mammary artery went onto the LAD .
He was extubated without complications and had his chest tubes removed in a standard fashion .
He then was up ambulating with physical therapy but very slowly , and he was quite weak .
He was felt to have a leukomoid reaction with his white count postop of around 90,000 .
This is currently around 30,000 to 40,000 .
Oncology and thoracic surgery were consulted .
He will be followed up the week after discharge to see Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Right</PHI> .
Radiation therapy was consulted , and it was felt that radiation therapy may be the most immediate treatment of the tumor .
He had a bone scan which showed positive uptake in the right first rib but was otherwise negative .
A head CT was negative .

He went to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tlowepeh Hospital</PHI> Emergency Room , where his blood pressure was 120/80 , heart rate was 94 , respiratory rate was 32 , and he had a blood gas which was pO2 73 , pH 7.44 , pCO2 32 , and a chest x-ray that showed mild congestive heart failure .
Chest pains were relieved with oxygen by nasal prong , two liters .
He was tansferred to the Coronary Care Unit where he was treated with IV nitroglycerin and Diltiazem .
He had a new apical systolic murmur noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/18</PHI> .
He had recurrent chest pains noted on both <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/17</PHI> three times , <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/19</PHI> one time , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/21</PHI> .
The episode on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/21</PHI> was noteworthy for shortness of breath and ST depression in V4-6 which required IV TNG , which was used briefly that night .

No known drug allergies .
Temperature of 97 degrees with a rate of 90 in atrial fibrillation and blood pressure 110/82 .
His jugulovenous distention was to 10 centimeters .
Heart examination showed a PMI , which was diffuse and inferiorly displaced with an auricular rhythm with an S1 and S2 , II/VI systolic ejection murmur , no rub or gallop was noted .
Rectal :
Sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN and creatinine of 29/1.4 , glucose 142 , hematocrit was 30.9 .
Pre-intubation ABG was pH of 7.39 , p02 81 , O2 saturation of 96% , C02 29 , total C02 18 .
After intubation his pH was 7.32 with a p02 208 , and 02 saturation 99.7% , pC02 28 , total C02 15 .
Repeat ABG done later had a pH of 7.38 p02 of 247 , O2 saturation of 99.9% , pC02 22 , total C02 of 14 .
Magnesium 2.1 initially and during the code was 1.8 , cholesterol 144 , triglyceride 121 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the unit and experienced some nausea and vomiting with minimal EKG changes .
He became tachycardic to the rate of 110 , with a blood pressure of 128 to 130 .
Later , within an half hour the blood pressure dipped into the 70s systolic , and IV fluid was started .
He was given Compazine PR and was started on Dopamine and then Dobutamine was added when that did not appear sufficient to increase his blood pressure above 80 .
His systolic blood pressure was then in the 100 to 110 range and at that time his IV fluids were decreased .
However , acutely at around 8:00 p.m. the systolic blood pressure plummeted down to 60 to 70 and at this time a chest x-ray was done which showed moderate CHF .
The patient complained of pain between his shoulder blades and at this time IV fluid was increased , so was the Dopamine and Dobutamine .
Even with the increase in the pressors , heart rate dropped into the 50s .
At this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .
There was a question of fleeting T waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead EKG .
At this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .
The rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.
The patient was without respirations or blood pressure .
Autopsy was requested , however , the patient &apos;s family will not give us their decision until tomorrow morning .

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE .
Unsigned
Report Status :
ADMISSION DATE :
congestive heart failure .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
aortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency .
Sulfonamides .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
cardiac catheterization - <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .
He also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .
Despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .
Over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .
There was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .
The right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .
There was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .
The liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .
Later , an echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .
The left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .
The aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .
There was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .
The left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .
There was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .
A Persantine Thallium scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .
LABORATORY DATA :
This was of uncertain significance .
The hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 .
There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .
The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .
The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .
The saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .
He seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">08-23</PHI>-92
Status post resection of a cerebellar medulloblastoma .
At baseline , he had lived with his guardians , <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Pandeprob</PHI> , he was &quot; slow &quot; , walked with a very ataxic gait , did not talk much and spends most of his time watching TV and smoking .
A recent head computerized tomography scan in <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>/92 was negative .
He had been evaluated by his local medical doctor for his weight loss .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Cerebellar brain carcinoma , status post surgery , chemotherapy and radiation therapy six to seven years ago .
He had not had any recurrence .
There was no cardiac disease , hypertension or diabetes mellitus .
He had no known drug allergies .
None .
The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation .
Extremities - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The discs were flat .
There was no retinopathy .
He had a gag and good palpate movement .
The tongue was midline .
There was a right facial droop which was mild .
LABORATORY DATA :
The head computerized tomography scan without contrast showed a 3 x 3 x 5 cm. hemorrhage extending form the left Sylvian fissure and put amen to the left front oparietal lobe .
There was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .
His blood pressure was not elevated .
The aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and B12 .
Once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .
An magnetic resonance imaging study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/17</PHI>/92 showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .
The medial region of the hematoma was felt to be suspicious for tumor versus arteriovenous malformation .
Given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar mass .
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest I minus on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/27</PHI>/92 did not show the mass initially noted .
A cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for mass effect from the hematoma .
A testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for mass .
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and G-tube was performed at the same time .
There was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .
An abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non-enhancing .
Initially , the patient remained drowsy until Decadron was added to his medical regimen .
He awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .
He was started on Dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .
He needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .
His pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .
There was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .
He had limited vertical up gaze .
His gag was intact with palatal movements .
On repetitive testing with Speech Therapy had not been able to swallow in a safe manner .
Thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .
He squints with his left eye when he tries to focus and claims this is because he sees double .
His deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the right with 3 right brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and patella .
On the left , his reflexes wee 2-2+ with a downgoing toe .
It was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .
The patient will be discharged to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Limestrict T Pio Medical Center</PHI> and will be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mo Muell</PHI> in one month in the Neurologic Clinic .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Nertland</PHI> is a 51 year old , otherwise healthy white female who presented to her local doctor with left hip pain and was found on x-ray to have a lytic lesion in the left femoral neck .
A bone scan was done and no other lesions were noted .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Significant for total abdominal hysterectomy , 1971 ; appendectomy , 1971 ; D and C .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Premarin .
ALLERGIES :
FAMILY HISTORY :
Positive for her mother with breast cancer , father leukemia , an aunt with bone cancer .
She is married , lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</PHI> , and is very involved with her church and prayer groups .
Social alcohol , no drugs .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
She is negative for weight loss .
Yearly mammogram is due .
HEENT :
Negative .
Neck :
Clear to auscultation .
Abdomen :
Benign without mass or organomegaly .
Extremities :
Sensory exam is intact to light touch and pinprick .
She underwent chest and abdominal CT .
The chest CT revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the right middle lobe , consistent with neoplastic disease .
CT was carried out to the level of the adrenals and kidneys , which appeared normal .
The frozen section revealed adenocarcinoma with characteristics most likely attributed to lung rather than the GI tract for primary site , based on the frozen section .
She did well and progressed with physical therapy and was able to do stairs with crutches , ambulating with a walker by postoperative day # 5 .
She was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Breunspeelm</PHI> from Oncology , who felt that most likely it was metastatic lung cancer to the bone ; however , breast cancer remains a possibility .
He also recommended that she be switched from Premarin to tamoxifen .
A letter will be sent regarding the recommendations .
The plan is for her to betreated at home by her local doctors .
Coumadin for six weeks after surgery , 2 mg q.d.
DISPOSITION :
Her staples can be taken out in 2-3 weeks after the surgery by her local doctor .
She was discharged home .
She received 2.5 mg of Coumadin on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/30</PHI> for a PT of 13.5 and 1 mg on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/01</PHI> for a PT of 14.5 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute polymicrobial bacterial endocarditis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Ascending aortic dissection , cutaneous drug eruption , diarrhea , congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , anuric renal failure , stroke , postoperative bleeding , mitral regurgitation , history of rheumatic fever .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">06/29</PHI>/93 - white cell scan ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/03</PHI>/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/05</PHI>/93 - brain magnetic resonance imaging study ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/05</PHI>/93 - abdominal computerized tomography scan ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07-08</PHI>-93 - cardiac ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/07</PHI>/93 - pelvic ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/09</PHI>/93 - barium enema ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/14</PHI>/93 - cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/93 - reopening of sternum ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/22</PHI>/93 - mediastinal exploration .
This extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .
She was in her usual state of health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/15</PHI>/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .
She was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .
Because of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">O Center</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Sondibrid Ey</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/20</PHI> , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .
Her antibiotics were appropriately changed .
At the family &apos;s request , the patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation .
Further evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .
The patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .
There was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .
In addition , she was evaluated by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Sileyer Medical Center</PHI> and there was no evidence of active dental infection .
Because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .
Her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .
Towards the end of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .
A rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .
She was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .
Also , no source for sepsis had been found .
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .
Accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/93 .
During her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .
She , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .
Her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .
She was returned to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/22</PHI> and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .
She subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .
After consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/26</PHI>/93 at 11:10 a.m.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
She has been under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aalv Manual</PHI> and was referred here for further therapy .
Her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .
She underwent cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-15</PHI>-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .
The main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .
The left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .
The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .
Her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .
Her physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in no acute distress .
Her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .
The jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle .
The chest was clear .
The second sound was normally split .
She had no murmurs and no gallops .
The examination the abdomen was benign .
The examination of the extremities showed no edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Her electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor R-wave progression in V1 through V4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction .
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service .
The patient was maintained on intravenous heparin .
Therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
Coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy .
Specifically , there was no decrease in the initial gain that she achieved after directional atherectomy .
She was transferred in stable condition to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Pasi</PHI> for further rehabilitation therapy .

Unremarkable .
The patient received his bone marrow transplant on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/12</PHI>/00 .
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/26</PHI>/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .

unremarkable
1. Neuro :
It was thought by NeuroRadiology that this lesion given its proximity to the petrous portion in bone would not be amenable to stenting .
Given the embolic appearance of the stroke the patient was changed from heparin to Plavix and aspirin for anticoagulation .
He was not placed on Coumadin given discussion with his primary care doctor and history of multiple GI bleeds on aspirin alone .
3. GI :
Recommended to have a thyroid fine needle biopsy for further evaluation .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Chiybelb</PHI> will be notified of this finding for follow up .

PT 13.7 / PTT 26.3 .
ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response .
This patent was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Memasound Honvanta Hospital</PHI> .
Following post deployment inflation , the vessel was at full volume without clot or dissection , and TIMI 3 flow .
She was maintained on Integrilin for 12 hours ; her sheaths were removed without difficulty .
MRI was recommended , and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/12</PHI> she underwent an MRI which revealed an acute infarct in the left posterior corona radiata and narrowing at the P2 segment of the right PCA .
After her right lower extremity weakness resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .
She had no further neurologic symptoms .
Following the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .
There was no evidence of GI bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .
She was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .
This echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .
She was seen in consultation by PT , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .
She however is at increased risk for further embolic phenomenon with atrial fibrillation .
She was maintained on Fragmin and will be considered for lowdose Coumadin once the Plavix is finished in a month if her gait and strength have improved .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">08/07</PHI>/2002
DISCHARGE DATE :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
She was diagnosis with a urinary tract infection and perineal inflammation and was transferred to the hospital and treated with IV Tequin for urinary tract infection .
Alumbar puncture of on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/31</PHI>/2002 was significant for an opening pressure reported as 12 cm of water .
Only 1 white blood cell was detected , and the fluid was culture and gram stain negative .
An electroencephalogram showed nonspecific , left greater than right slowing , without epileptiform spikes .
Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was found to be 48 .
Lupus anticoagulant was weakly positive , as was a D-dimer .
Peritoneal dialysis x ten years , resulting from that .
Aspirin 81 mg qd , Epogen 10,000 units tiw , folate 4 mg qd , K-Dur 20 mEq , magnesium oxide 400 mg po qd , Phenergan 12.5 mg q4h prn , Prinivil 5 mg qd , Renagel 20 mg po qd , vitamin E 400 IU bid , pamidronate 30 mg IV q3months .
ALLERGIES :
Not available at the time .
At baseline by report the patient was self-sufficient and aided in the care of her husband .
She was raised in the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</PHI> and spent many years on an organic farm .
Noncontributory .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
In general , she was well appearing in no apparent distress .
The pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with good bowel sounds .
There was no hepatosplenomegaly .
She moved all extremities .
She missed her nose with both hands when asked to touch her nose .
There was a questionable positive Babinski on the right side .
The toes were downgoing on the left .
She appeared to understand questions , but then could not come up with the answers , or where she was , and she could not give her name , but did respond when her name was used .
Her liver function tests were all within normal limits .
Her coagulation factors showed a PT of 13.2 , INR 1.2 , PTT 23.2 .
Her white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 .
Abdominal CT scan from the outside hospital showed no abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts .
Head CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/30</PHI>/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient &apos;s presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer &apos;s of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .
In addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .
In addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .
For prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .
However , these antibodies were both within normal limits .
The patient &apos;s mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/10</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/12</PHI> and was markedly improved on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/13</PHI>/2002 , compared with the day of admission .
The nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .
On the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
He was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Utal Health</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Kennedy</PHI> with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to OM of the left circumflex .
He has had three-pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and nocturia three to four times per night but no swelling and no weight gain ( although he has had four-inch increase in his abdominal girth in the past year ) .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He also complains of 30-yard dyspnea on exertion and one-block claudication .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Carbon</PHI> , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
The night before admission , his blood pressure was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 .

On HEENT exam , pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation .
His JVP was difficult to assess with a questionable meniscus near the ear at 45 degrees .
Cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate .
The PMI was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .
Heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .
There was no apparent S3 .
Chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .
Abdomen was obese .
Abdominal exam revealed surgical scars and questionable hepatojugular reflux .
Liver was 10 cm. in width , 2 to 3 cm. below the rib .
Extremities were warm with good distal pulses .
Neurologic exam was non focal .
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact .

The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable P-R interval , QRS of 0.09 , and QTC of 0.42 .
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
A right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 .
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed , and his medications were tailored over the course of the following 48 hours by following the appropriate parameters .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no complications from this procedure , and he remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of discharge .

Report Status :
ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">05/01</PHI>/92
DIAGNOSIS :
2. Pulmonary congestion .
4. Chronic obstructive lung disease .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
A temporary pacemaker on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/4</PHI>/92 , coronary angiogram and left and right heart catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/5</PHI>/92 , and permanent VVI-pacemaker on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/6</PHI>/92 , using an Intermedex pacemaker at 292-03 number , and set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. &apos;s .
She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .
She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.
Her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .
She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Avejoh Wierst</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Pedines Community Hospital</PHI> found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .
On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .
We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .
A cardiac catheterization was carried out on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/5</PHI> , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .
There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .
The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .
Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .
With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .
A permanent pacemaker was put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/6</PHI>/92 .
She tolerated the procedure well .
On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .

Primary repair of atrioseptal defect , patent foramen ovale .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">List</PHI> is a 67 year-old diabetic woman with a known thoracic aortic dissection .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 29</PHI> , 1996 , the patient developed abdominal and back pain and presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Drain Hospital</PHI> .
A dissected descending thoracic aorta was diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiogram .
She was intubated with pulmonary edema and followed by serial examinations .
The patient refused surgery per report .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January 2</PHI> CT scan of the chest showed a type III descending thoracic aortic aneurysm beginning distal to the left subclavian artery and ending above the renal artery .
There was a low density abnormality surrounding the ascending aorta .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January 23</PHI> , 1996 , the patient had a CT scan , again showing ascending aorta with low density abnormality , with findings suspicious for involvement of the ascending aorta by dissection , bilateral pleural effusions were improved .
The patient reports having been hospitalized for approximately one month , at which time she was discharged to a nursing home after refusing surgery .
The patient has had dyspnea on exertion since <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> , 1996 , increasing in the last month , and increasing abdominal distention .
She has had atrial fibrillation for five years .
She does orthopnea of three to four pillows .
No syncope but she occasionally has dizziness .
As above .
Hypertension .
Hiatal hernia .
Status post umbilical hernia repair .
Status postventral hernia repair .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS :
Her medications on admission were aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Lopressor 50 milligrams p.o.b.i.d. ; Glyburide 2.5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Premarin 0.625 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Lasix 40 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Trandate 200 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Prevacid 30 milligrams p.o. q.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure is 138/72 .
She is on room air at 90% .
Oropharynx showed poor dentition with apparent decay of the remaining teeth and gum recession .
The lungs demonstrated wheezes on auscultation with crackles at the bases .
Cardiovascular was irregularly irregular rhythm and rate .
The abdomen was obese , protuberant , nontender with well-healed surgical scars .
Extremities showed no clubbing or cyanosis .
Varicosities particularly left lower extremity front and back and right upper extremity medially .
There were 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally , 2+ radial pulses bilaterally .
Neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Significant for white blood cell count of 6.8. BUN 14 , creatinine 1 .
Liver function tests were within normal limits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for preoperative work-up prior to planned repair of her ascending aortic dissection .
Given her history reported from outside source of a bleeding diathesis , Hematology consult was obtained who felt that she had no evidence of qualitative abnormality orcoagulopathy .
The patient was evaluated by the Dental Service , who felt that it was necessary to extract several teeth and to follow several more , specifically tooth 15 and 16 , that were fully impacted .
The patient underwent echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 25</PHI> , 1997 , demonstrating 2/4+ tricuspid regurgitation with a peak velocity of 2.9 ; mitral regurgitation 2/4 , mild concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle ; no systolic function with mild septal hypokinesis .
The ejection fraction was estimated at 55% .
The ascending aorta appeared severely dilated immediately after the root at 7.7 centimeters .
Dissection flap was noted .
There was pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 34 mmHg plus right atrial pressure .
There was also evidence of a secundum type atrioseptal defect , approximately 0.5 centimeters in size , with elevated right atrial pressure .
True lumen could not be accessed from either the left or right femoral artery .
Postoperatively the patient did require epinephrine and Levophed as well as resuscitation , multiple blood products .
On postoperative day number one , however , the patient was hemodynamically stable on a small amount of heparin and nitroglycerin with a cardiac index of 3 .
The patient was transferred to the floor after a slow ventilator wean .
She did demonstrate evidence of a right brachial neuropathy , likely associated with the extensive dissection required for access to the right axillary artery , given the patient &apos;s distorted anatomy due to the large dissection .
The patient has been chronically in atrial fibrillation preoperatively without Coumadin therapy .
The patient did require extensive pulmonary toilet and she continues to benefit from nebulizer therapy , chest physiotherapy and diuresis .
Her chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated bilateral small effusions , right greater than left .

Report Status :
Discharge Date :
1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .
2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .
3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/17</PHI>/91 .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
He was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> as an out-patient .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/08</PHI>/91 , the patient called Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
2) Recent PCP .
3) Status post right elbow surgery .
4) Venereal disease history .
5) PPD anergic .
Revealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .
He had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .
LUNGS :
There was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
RECTAL :
He had guaiac positive stools .
EXTREMITIES :
Unremarkable .
GENITOURINARY :
His penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .
Non-focal .
On admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .
Sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .
ALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .
His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/12</PHI>/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/13</PHI>/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
The patient died in hospital .

DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
WORD DISABILITY AND PROBABLY DURATION :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotereef</PHI> is a <PHI TYPE="AGE">93-year-old</PHI> woman who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daleglo Medical Center</PHI> with renal insufficiency .
The patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
She also has a history of urinary tract infection .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
She also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .
However , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .
Her systolic blood pressure was 110 .
She appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .
The patient had been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
At that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
The patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
Her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .
Her BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
Initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .
However , with the assistance of the patient &apos;s granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .
The patient will be transferred tomorrow to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Naplesvillechaelty</PHI> .

Discharge Summary
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1) FOREIGN BODY EXTRACTION OF CHICKEN FROM ESOPHAGUS .
5) HISTORY OF PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION .
9) STATUS POST ILEUS SECONDARY TO GENERAL ANESTHESIA FOR TOOTH EXTRACTION ON THIS ADMISSION .
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a long history of alcohol abuse , withdrawal seizures , and hypopharyngeal cancer now admitted with foreign body in hypopharynx .
Recently the patient noticed hoarseness secondary to vocal cord involvement of the tumor .
On the day of admission the patient was in a detox center undergoing detox prior to beginning his XRT and was in his usual state of health at that time when he had the acute onset of coughing after swallowing some chicken a la king .
In the Emergency Room the patient underwent EGD by GI where a large piece of chicken was visualized at the level of the cricopharyngeus .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Alcohol abuse complicated by hepatitis , cirrhosis , seizure disorder , encephalopathy .
6) Question of internal capsule CVA on CT scan .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission he is a disheveled elderly male uncooperative with the exam .
Neck exam no JVD or lymphadenopathy .
Abdominal exam obese , hypoactive bowel sounds , non-tender , some guarding , no rebound tenderness .
Extremities with trace pedal edema , 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses .
LABORATORY DATA :
LFTs revealed ALT of 44 , AST of 36 , LDH of 277 , alk phos 155 , total bili 0.7 , and direct bili 0.4. Total protein 7.2 , albumin 3.7 , calcium 9.3. PT and PTT were 13.3 and 23.5 respectively .
UA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .
EGD was performed .
Subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .
There was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .
The patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/22</PHI>/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .
The patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .
The patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .
Other GI issues include the patient &apos;s hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .
2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .
Because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .
3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .
A swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .
Several NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .
He was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient &apos;s mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .
Other options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient &apos;s poor prognosis for the future .
The family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient &apos;s nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .
It is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .
The patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/22</PHI>/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .
The patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .
5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .
He had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .
The patient continued to be asymptomatic .
The patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .
7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .
It was decided the patient &apos;s code status would not be DNR , DNI .
8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .
Laboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .
The last UA and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/27</PHI>/93 .
1) Aspiration pneumonia .
3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .
DISPOSITION :
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient is to be transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Paw.ryfear Medical Center</PHI> for further care including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and further nutritional support .
Pepcid 20 mg po IV b.i.d. for history of gastritis and GI bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. ( this may be discontinued as the patient becomes more mobile and active ) , tube feeds with Jevity at 75 cc / hour full strength-please check residuals .
Feeding tube should be flushed q4h with 20 to 30 cc of warm water to prevent clogging of feeding tube .

<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Daie Elms</PHI> was a 50-year-old male , who underwent cadaveric renal transplant in 1992 , who presented with a three-week old scrape of the right popliteal fossa related to a prosthesis .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ; hypertension ; peripheral vascular disease ; coronary artery disease ; bilateral vitrectomies ; cadaveric renal transplant ; suprapubic tube for ureteral necrosis ; status post right below-knee amputation and left below-knee amputation ; asthma ; atrial fibrillation ; left arm arteriovenous fistula .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Minipress .
Digoxin .
Imuran .
Lasix .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination was remarkable for poor dentition .
The neck was supple without adenopathy .
The chest examination was remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally , with regular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and obese .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Elms</PHI> was admitted to the hospital , and after multiple cultures were drawn , he was subsequently taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/21</PHI>/96 for incision and drainage of a right thigh abscess .
His clinical condition continued to worsen with evidence of ongoing sepsis and renal failure , which transiently improved on hemodialysis , but generally progressively worsened .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/3</PHI>/96 , he underwent a transverse colostomy to allow diversion from the nonhealing leg and pelvis wounds .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
He was intubated at this time and could not be extubated thereafter .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
The family was notified , but declined a postmortem examination .

Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotekoorsner</PHI> is a 57 year old white woman with mitral stenosis , atrial fibrillation , and cardiac risk factors including a positive family history , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia who presented for catheterization because of progressive worsening of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was told that she had a heart murmur approximately twenty years ago .
She now gives a history of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and fatigue which has become more incapacitating over the past several months .
She states that previously , she had been fairly active but now does not feel that she can do much of anything .
She also has had a cough for the past several years which is worse in the wintertime and is non-productive .
She denies hemoptysis , orthopnea , or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
Her course has been complicated by atrial fibrillation first diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">New Years Eve</PHI> of l989 and she has been on Digoxin and Coumadin .
Because of her worsening symptoms , the patient had an echocardiogram at an outside hospital in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Chogejuan St.ver , New Hampshire</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of l989 which showed mitral stenosis .
ALLERGIES :
She had no known drug allergies .
The patient lives with her husband in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Glendmin</PHI> .
Vital signs showed that she had a blood pressure on the right which was l80/ll0 and a blood pressure on the left arm which was l84/ll0 , her pulse was 90 and was irregularly irregular , and her respirations were l6 per minute and were unlabored .
LUNGS :
There was jugular venous distention to l7 cm at 45 degrees .
The point of maximal impulse was at the fifth intercostal space in the mid clavicular line .
There was an opening snap immediately following the P2 .
There was a diastolic rumble at the apex which radiates to the axilla which is graded as a I / VI .
There was also a I / VI apical systolic murmur .
The patient &apos;s peripheral pulses were full .
Soft , slightly distended , and there was a slight right upper quadrant fullness .
However , there was evidence of subtle mental status change on the evening after the patient &apos;s valvuloplasty .
She was having difficulty remembering certain events which had occurred that day .

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was a 56 year old white male who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> for rule out pancreatic pseudocyst .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> had a past medical history which included Wegener &apos;s granulomatosis , history of an anterior myocardial infarction , and gallstone pancreatitis .
On his current admission , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Free Medical Center</PHI> .
At that time , he spiked a temperature to 103 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
2. Coronary artery disease , status post anterior myocardial infarction , in 1993 .
Recent echocardiogram suggests ejection fraction of 15% .
4. Mild dementia .
MEDICATIONS :
3. Digoxin , 0.125 mg. , intravenously , qD .
4. Imipenem , 500 mg. , intravenously , q6h.
5. Nitropaste , one-half inch to chest wall , q6h.
6. Vasotec .
7. Alterajel .
9. Haldol .
ALLERGIES :
Ativan .
In general , confused white man , in mild distress .
Vital signs :
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat was benign .
His neck was supple .
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no extra heart sounds , abdomen distended with an epigastric mass noted , mildly tender to palpation , no guarding .
White count was 14.4 , hematocrit was 36.2 , platelet count was 217 , sodium was 135 , potassium was 3.3 , chloride was 99 , bicarbonate was 25 , BUN was 40 , creatinine was 1.9 , glucose was 124 , urinalysis was negative , PT was 12.2 , PTT was 24.5 , calcium was 7.8 , phosphorus was 3.7 , albumin was 2.3 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , alkaline phosphatase was 202 , SGPT was 32 , SGOT was 64 , LDH was 998 , amylase was 150 .
Evidence of old left anterior septal infarct .
Gallbladder was visualized with stones .
He was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/27</PHI> .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
This 28 day course was completed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/15</PHI>/95 .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
He did have problems with po intake .
He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .
After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Douet</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
The patient has an ostomy appliance around the former site of his pancreatic fistula drain .
The patient is also treated with shots of morphine for intermittent pain .

DUODENAL PERFORATION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient noted onset of diffuse abdominal pain , periumbilical and epigastric in nature , nausea and vomiting and back pain starting at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission , <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/00 .
The patient denies fevers , chills or sweats , shortness of breath or chest pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
White blood cell count 4.5 , hematocrit 31.9 , creatinine 1.1 .
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 65 , blood pressure 101/74 , 100 percent oxygen saturation on room air .
Soft , slightly distended , nontender .
There was no evidence of perforation on the CT scan .
At this point the patient &apos;s creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for the prospect of sepsis given his neutropenia and previous splenectomy and then an echocardiogram was performed to assess left ventricular function .
The Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .
Upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .
An incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .
Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .
In the abdomen the patient &apos;s retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled-off .
He was hydrated vigorously .
Further debridement was undertaken .
The patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .
Unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .
The patient &apos;s family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16</PHI>/00 .
The patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/17</PHI>/00 .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
2. Congestive heart failure .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">5/18</PHI>/99 Coronary artery bypass graft using the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and posterior left ventricular artery and the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery .
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with accelerating angina pectoris , who had a cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Chimass Community Hospital</PHI> revealing three-vessel disease .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for a cardiac surgical evaluation .
Her CKs were found to be elevated with a peak of 1237 with only one increase in MB fractionation .
She had a repeat cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Chimass Community Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/13</PHI>/99 , which showed three-vessel disease , including right coronary artery 70% ostial , left anterior descending 70% , circumflex 100% .
Her ejection fraction was estimated at 60% .
There was 1 mitral regurgitation .
The patient was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The bypasses are listed above .
The bypass time was 2 hours , 19 minutes , cross-clamp time was 1 hour , 36 minutes .
The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells .
Postoperatively , the patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was routine .
Prior to her transfer to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 12 Unit</PHI> , her last cardiac index in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit had been between 2.0 and 2.2 .
2. Renal :
Her potassium was 4.3 .
Her creatinine was 4.2. 3 .
Her regular insulin consisted of insulin sliding scale .
It should be pointed out , however , that a urinalysis from <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/14</PHI>/99 showed positive white blood cells .
However , this was in the setting of the patient , who more than likely has colonization of her bladder secondary to decreased to no urine output .
At the time of discharge , the patient was in satisfactory condition , tolerating good PO intake on her renal diet .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
NPH insulin 8 units subq q PM before dinner .
Aspirin 81 mg. PO QD .
Phoslo 6 mg. PO TID .
Epogen 4000 units IV on Tuesdays and Wednesdays .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/20</PHI>/1991
The patient is a seventy-two-year-old male with a history of diffuse atherosclerotic disease who had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 followed a failed angioplasty .
The patient had done well until about two weeks prior to admission when he started developing several episodes of chest pain with minimal exertion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission physical exam he had a blood pressure of 152/92 , pulse 80 and regular , respirations 18 .
On cardiac exam he had a slightly diffuse point of maximal impulse , normal S1 , split S2 , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the left sternal border , positive S4 .
The left femoral is barely perceptible , right femoral two plus with a bruit .
The electrocardiogram on admission was normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis , left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had recurrent chest pain at rest in the hospital .
We were very reluctant to recommend further invasive interventions in view of his dissuse atherosclerosis and renal failure , which make him a very high risk candidate for further PTCAs .
The patient was anemic .
On presentation he had a hematocrit of 29.5 secondary to renal failure .
He was transfused during the hospitalization .
He is to have a low cholesterol , low fat renal diet .
He is to be followed-up by his private doctor .

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS :
Question seizure / loss of consciousness with hypoglycemia , fingerstick blood sugar of 24 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Of note , the patient has had melena times months with multiple blood transfusions at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Usoak Rinix Hospital</PHI> .
The patient , after having his melanotic stool , had a question seizure-like activity with question loss of consciousness .
EMS was called and found the patient &apos;s fingerstick blood sugar to be 24 .
The patient at that time had slurred speech with altered mental status .
The patient at the site was given 1 amp of D50 .
Fingerstick blood sugar on repeat was 190 .
The patient was transferred to the ED .
Of note , in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Genearocktemp Ry Health</PHI> ED the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 23.7 down from low 30s , a troponin of 5.8 , and an EKG with afib showing peak T-waves .
Thus , the patient was admitted to the Medical Service for GI workup including possibly EGD .
Of note , the patient had a previously scheduled EGD for <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/17</PHI> .
Ischemia :
The patient is status post a non ST elevation MI , a troponin peaked at 22 likely secondary to dehydration and presentation of acute renal failure .
The patient was managed on a beta blocker .
Aspirin was held second to his concurrent GI bleed .
Pump :
Of note , the patient was transfused for a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells during this admission .
Overall , the patient had preserved LV function despite a large troponin leak .
Coumadin and aspirin are held again secondary to his concurrent GI bleed .
Hematocrit was checked q.8h and the patient was transfused again , as noted above , a total of 4 units packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of less than 30 .
The patient was started on Protonix IV 40 b.i.d.
Per GI consult given the patient &apos;s non ST elevation MI he would be a high risk candidate for a GI endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non ST elevation MI period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective GI workup in 4-6 weeks .
On admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
The patient was restarted on a low dose glipizide at 2.5 mg and adjustments to be made at the next PCP visit .
Has remained stable above 30 without any need for further transfusions .
On discharge his hematocrit is 35.4 .

Hepatitis B-related cirrhosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
(2) Hepatic encephalopathy .
(4) Hepatic hydrothorax on the right .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Chest tube placement on the right .
This is a 60-year-old Mandarin speaking gentleman , with a long history of end-stage liver disease secondary to Hepatitis B. infection diagnosed approximately six years prior to admission , who now presents with recurrence of right-sided hydrothorax thought to be related as an ascitic equivalent on the right side .
The patient has been admitted multiple times with this symptom , and in this setting , was called in to the hospital by his primary care doctor on the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath , and dyspnea on exertion .
He was admitted to the Medical Service where he was found to have a transudative , right-sided effusion thought again to be the equivalent of his ascites on the basis of end-stage liver disease .
It was tapped and drained with placement of a chest tube .
In the Intensive Care Unit , his chest tube continued to have massive volume output , and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid .
His renal function continued to worsen and he developed hypervolemic hyponatremia , and hemodynamic parameters consistent with sepsis .
During the first week of <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> in spite of antibiosis , the patient developed worsening renal failure , became anuric , and developed rapid progression in spite of his chest tube of the right-sided hydrothorax in addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome vs. extreme volume overload .
In consultation with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leynslentnerswaimjesc</PHI> and with his gastrointestinal physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Loydbreunlinke</PHI> , and with the patient &apos;s family , the decision was made in the setting of his grim prognosis and multiple morbidities that further aggressive treatment would not be pursued .
The patient was evaluated for continuous venous venous hemodialysis , which in the end in the setting of the family &apos;s wishes , was not begun with this patient .
The time of death was 5:16 A.M. on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th of February</PHI> , 1997 .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leynslentnerswaimjesc , Lau</PHI> , and <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Launtburce</PHI> were notified .

Cardiac exam was regular S1 and S2 , no murmur .
Chest clear to auscultation with a few fine crackles at the left base .
Extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .
There was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .
Neurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .
Cranial nerves intact .

PT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .
UA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .
There was no CSF density .
These findings were consistent with the cord compression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/25</PHI>/94 .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) ONCOLOGY :
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .

DISCHARGE DATE :
Acute myocardial infarction .
urinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , Parkinson &apos;s disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease x &apos;s 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall .
He reports lower abdominal pain x&apos;s 2 days .
They went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for admission .
He was recently started on a Texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
He had no known drug allergies .
The patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .
He was continued on his Parkinson &apos;s medications .
A head CT was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Factor</PHI> agreed he would review the CTs and follow the patient while in house .
He was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .
Thus , he was considered ready for discharge .
He again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .
He was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .
Anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .
He had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .
The right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .
He was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .
He surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .
He was dynamically stable on his Dobutamine with improved oxygenation .
The patient continued fairly stable while intubated .
He had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .
His neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .
They did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .
The repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .
The lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .
Discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .
He was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .
The patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .
No further blood draws were done .
The patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous Morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .
Comfort measures continued until the day <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 , where Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Koteleebdils</PHI> was found to be pulseless , without respirations .
He was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 .

Discharge Summary
Report Status :
She first presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1990 with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke &apos;s B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .
She then represented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1996 with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .
At the time of surgery there was no evidence of liver disease .
Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .
One of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .
She was therefore staged Dukes C2 .
She began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .
An MRI was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/25</PHI>/96 to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .
However , they were unable to rule out a soft tissue abnormality at L5 encroaching on a neural foramen .
She presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/8</PHI>/96 with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .
(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .
(4) Osteoporosis .
(5) Hypercholesterolemia .
(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenni Pain</PHI> .
An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .
These findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .
She was admitted and made NPO .
On admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 .
She was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
Her ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .
She was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .
She was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on TPN .
Of note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was unremarkable .
Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .
He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .
The patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .
He was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .
He therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation .
The patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction .
He did have some postoperative hypertension which was controlled with Cardura and sublingual nifedipine prn .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY

<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">TLANDSHUFFBREUTZLEESE , EZEJO N</PHI>
<PHI TYPE="DATE">07/12</PHI>/2004
<PHI TYPE="DATE">07/29</PHI>/2004
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Secondary neoplasm of bone ( extensive ) .
2. Primary malignant neoplasm of the breast ( resected ) .
5. Deconditioning .
8. History of perforated gastric ulcer treated with hemigastrectomy <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/2004 .
She had actually completed her five years of Tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch .
Not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement .
She had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness .
Up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease .
Her lungs were clear .
She had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement .
The rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Bilirubin normal .
Her alk phos slightly up at 174 .
WBC 10.8 with normal differential .
A urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells .
The patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of Zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .
She gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle .
This was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site .
She also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral MRIs to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression .
A single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain .
Escalate the doses of the Dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o&apos;clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on Remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional SSRI overlap until it seems to show more affect .
She lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .
The patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .
She was begun on Letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of Xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">First</PHI> &apos;s office to have further discussions of this later approach .
Zofran 8 mg p.o. q.8 p.r.n. nausea .
Tylenol 1-2 tabs q.4 p.r.n. pain .
Multivitamin , Megace 200 mg p.o. q.d. ( appetite stimulant ) .
Fragmin 5000 units subq b.i.d. Oxycodone controlled-release ( OxyContin ) 10 mg p.o. q.12 hours .

The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health immediately prior to this hospitalization with no history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms , fever , cough , vomiting , diarrhea or decreased appetite .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Respiratory :
The patient remained intubated and maintained on a Pavulon and Morphine drip through until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/92 .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room where bronchoscopy was done .
The patient was noted to have a stenosis of the proximal trachea approximately 3 cm long just below the vocal cords .
The patient was also noted to have mild right mainstem bronchus stenosis too .
I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative .
There is one Gram stain that showed some polys but otherwise they have been unremarkable .
The patient received oxygen for approximately 24 hours after the tracheostomy and is presently being maintained on room air with a humidified mask .
Cardiac :
The patient is otherwise stable .
These T waves have since cleared and the patient is otherwise unremarkable .
Please note that the last arterial blood gases was Ph 7.40 , PCO2 of 41 , PO2 of 112 , bicarbonate of 25 .
Fluids and Nutrition :
The patient has presently been weaned over to his regular diet which is generally some crackers , cereal and occasional bits of food .
The patient generally does not drink much fluid .
This was felt to be mild aspiration .
The patient also had episodes of frequent coughing .
Clinical examination shows no decreased breath sounds .
The repeat X-Ray is generally clear and the patient is generally in no distress .
The patient was made NPO on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/25</PHI> a.m. Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> &apos;s team is coming to evaluate the patient .
Recommendations include probable evaluation for aspiration of upper airway contents and possible G tube placement in the future .
The patient has a history of longstanding constipation generally requires an enema every couple of days .
The patient has generally been stable .
His hematocrit on transfer was 33% .
The platelet count was 351,000 .
The estimated blood loss was minimal .
Renal :
The patient has a history of of seizure disorder .
Levels on arrival showed a Phenobarbital level of 25 , Tegretrol level of 3.1 .
The patient has had problems taking p.o. Tegretol during this hospitalization and levels need to be checked in the near future .
Phenobarbital has been maintained by intravenous 30 mg b.i.d.
Infectious Disease :
The patient arrived receiving ceftriaxone for one day down in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</PHI> .
The patient was switched over to Ancef to cover for Staph and usual flora for possible pneumonia .
The child only had a one time spike on pod 1 to 103 .
Three trach aspirates have all been unremarkable .
The blood cultures are unremarkable , sputum cultures are unremarkable , urinalysis was also negative .
The patient cannot be cathed as he has a recent hypospadias repair .
The patient will be transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ral Medical Center</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Saintarv</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/25</PHI>/92 by ambulance .
The trach appears to be quite stable and the patient is tolerating having his trach in quite nicely with a humidified mask .
The plans per ENT are that the patient &apos;s trach will not be changed for at least one months time .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> will contact Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Roosekote</PHI> as to probable plans .
It appears that Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> wants to re-evaluate the child in 4 to 6 weeks with another bronchoscopy and feels that possibly tracheal reconstruction may be possible at that time .
If you have any questions please contact me .
The number is <PHI TYPE="PHONE">329-216-2977</PHI> .

Discharge Summary
Admission Date :
Report Status :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">06/22</PHI>/1991
METASTATIC CERVICAL CARCINOMA .
Echocardiogram times two .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanor</PHI> .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
On ultrasound in <PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .
She was evaluated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mielke</PHI> , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .
She was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Weekscook University Medical Center</PHI> with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
She was therefore transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.
Emaciated white female in mild respiratory distress .
HEENT :
Regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .
RECTAL :
EXTREMITIES :
Electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .
She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/11</PHI> .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/19</PHI> , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/20</PHI> .
She was noted , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/16</PHI> , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .
Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .
She was hooked up with support services in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961</PHI> for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/22</PHI>/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mielke</PHI> and home care services .

DISCHARGE DATE :
Esophageal carcinoma-metastatic .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Po</PHI> is a 53 year-old white male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who is admitted with a 10-day history of progressive dyspnea on exertion .
He received two cycles of neoadjuvant Cisplatin and 5-FU , followed by esophagectomy , followed by two cycles of adjuvant platinum/5-FU .
He was without evidence of disease until the <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of 1994 , when he developed an inferior vena cava thrombosis and CT scan revealed celiac axis adenopathy .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1994 , pulmonary disease , consistent with lymphangetic spread of tumor , was present .
He began Ifosfamide chemotherapy but in the last few cycles has had progressive disease .
Atrovent , Proventil , Azmacort , Serevent inhalers .
Coumadin , Tagamet , and Clarithromycin .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam reveals mild proptosis .
His neck is supple .
His lungs reveal diffuse wheezes , especially in the left chest .
There is minimal air movement on the left lower lobe .
The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable .
Laboratory studies on admission included a BUN and creatinine of 14 and 1.4 , normal calcium , white count of 12,100 , hematocrit of 32 , platelet count of 319,000 .
However , there was the possibility that this represented an atypical pulmonary infection .
Hence , he went to bronchoscopy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jesclinke</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/22</PHI>/95 .
BAL was sent for culture and was negative for pathogenic organisms .
A few days after bronchoscopy , his intravenous Bactrim was discontinued and he was treated with oxygen , steroids , and inhalers .
It was felt that there were no further chemotherapy options for this disease and he met with hospice therapy .
In addition , he was hypoxic throughout his admission , often with oxygen saturations in the high 80s despite five liters of supplemental oxygen .

This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
He was later seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Flo Cuchkote</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
There was no definite clonic activity .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
no known drug allergies .
2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in World War II .
4) old right frontal infarct .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Tobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use .
He was a previous drinker of one &quot; old fashioned &quot; every night .
FAMILY HISTORY :
There was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .
He was afebrile .
In general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .
oropharynx was intubated with blood as well .
Lungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .
He does not regard the examiner .
He had no blink to threat .
He had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally .
He had no gag to tube manipulation .
Motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :

HOSPITAL COURSE :
This 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jan 22</PHI> , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .
He was extubated on postoperative day number one .
His neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .
He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .
He noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .
He underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Feb 04</PHI> , 1997 .
Prior to admission Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .
After conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .
It was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .
His lumbar drain was removed after five days .
He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .
He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .

<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">TLANDSEUSS , CHERE C</PHI>
<PHI TYPE="ID">083-97-79</PHI>
ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">09/15</PHI>/1998
DISCHARGE DATE :
The patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay Memorial Hospital Of</PHI> for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of chest pain and in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
He was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .
He denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
He continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation and management .
Prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
Lisinopril 10 mg bid .
Aspirin .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
He was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .
His lungs were clear throughout .
His apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .
Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .
His creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .
His hematocrit was 49.3 .
His electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .
There were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .
The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .
Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .
His initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .
Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/17</PHI>/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .
He had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .
The patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/20</PHI>/98 .
There was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .
Radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .
He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .
His Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .
After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .
His INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .
Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .
Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .
He was discharged in stable condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/23</PHI>/98 .
FOLLOW-UP :
He will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Taarnna Service</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> as well as Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lupevickette Folk</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Dwainco Rallsversgach</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Villean Garl</PHI> .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

EPIGLOTTITIS .
She was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .
She did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
She denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .
She was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .
Apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ez Ephtro Health Center</PHI> where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .
She was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .
She did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .
She was febrile to 101.7 .
ENT consult was obtained .
A lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
Negative .
None .
ALLERGIES :
None .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
Alcohol none .
The patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
Neck :
Otherwise normal and the trachea was midline .
Hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
The left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
No masses .
Back :
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Revealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .
As noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
The chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
She was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
At the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .
She had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .
She was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .
EKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .
She went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .
Otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .
Once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .
After extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
O2 saturations looked good .
Her white counts came down .
Blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .
Her mental status began to clear under the family &apos;s request .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/9</PHI>/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .
Our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .
Discharge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .

3) Clostridium difficile colitis with diarrhea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/95 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/30</PHI>/95 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/95 , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 there were revisions and contrast injections to the biliary catheter drainage system .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The present illness is marked by presentation with jaundice and pain in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 1994 , and a computerized tomography scan that showed bile duct dilatation .
Since that time he had been persistently jaundiced and fatigued , until three weeks prior to admission when the patient had a biliary tube check , which showed things to be patent despite his rising bilirubin .
His lungs were clear .
His head and neck showed marked scleral icterus and a cardiac examination showed a systolic ejection murmur .
The abdomen was soft and had well healed right upper quadrant scar .
LABORATORY DATA :
He was admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics and studied with an abdominal computerized tomography scan .
What then ensued was multiple attempts to insure adequate biliary decompression by use of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram and placement of biliary catheters and stents .
The procedures took place on several days throughout the hospital stay with the sentinel pro cedure taking place on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , and this was placement of the 10 mm diameter metal wallstents .
Subsequent to that , he was found to have a subhepatic fluid collection , which was suspicious for a bile leak and therefore a drain was placed percutaneously into this collection .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/95 and <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , very mild revisions were made of these and the feeling was that solution had been reached with good drainage .
His bilirubin by the time of discharge had fallen from a peak of 28 down to a discharge value of 8 .
During the course of the hospitalization , he was found to have diarrhea and stool was sent and found to be positive for Clostridium difficile toxin and this initiated treatment with Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for two weeks .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , it was deemed he was ready for discharge and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Blinjesc</PHI> discharged him to the care of his primary physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ma</PHI> , in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Taette</PHI> .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ma</PHI> will be working with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Besti Kotebreun</PHI> of <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> to manage the currently indwelling stents .

Report Status :
ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">04-09</PHI>-94
He was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l988 .
He was treated at that time with TPA .
He again did well until approximately late l992 .
He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .
His angiograms from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
Specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .
Following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .
He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .
He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .
Following that admission in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
He had multiple admissions to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .
His medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .
His most recent admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> is on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 5</PHI> , of 1994 .
Because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-9</PHI>-94 .
There is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .
Of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .
His medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .
His blood pressure l60/90 .
His jugular venous pressure was normal .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
He had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
Normal chloride and CO2 .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .
To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-10</PHI>-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .
The right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .
That is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .
After an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Because of the ongoing nature of his pain .
He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .
Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .
He was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
Because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .
Prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 13</PHI> .
That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .
On the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .
That was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .
This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .
After extended discussions with pain service , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> was brought back down to the pain clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 27</PHI> .
There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .
Once again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .
The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .
He had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 27</PHI> , 1995 .

DIAGNOSIS :
SKIN RASH .
VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient had a history of chronic atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure , who actually underwent a right breast biopsy and was off Coumadin for 5 days .
However , the patient denied any periods of prolonged inactivity .
The patient gave a history of atypical angina and exertion brings on left scapular pain without radiation .
This is also associated with nausea and diaphoresis .
The pain resolved spontaneously with rest .
Over the past day , the patient developed progressively increasing lower extremity edema and abdominal girth , accompanied by dyspnea on exertion , but no shortness of breath at rest .
He had weight gain of approximately 23 pounds over the last 7 days , associated with leg edema and he had also developed scrotal edema and had mild difficulty urinating .
The patient experienced no symptomatic relief .
He was seen in clinic by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Stisie H. Pain</PHI> , who felt he had congestive heart failure exacerbation , although myocardial infarction , pulmonary embolism , inferior vena cava obstruction could not be totally ruled out .
The patient had an exercise tolerance test with thallium in <PHI TYPE="DATE">11</PHI>-90 , and stopped after 7 minutes secondary to fatigue , shortness of breath , maximum heart rate 170 , and there were ST changes which were nondiagnostic .

Thoracoabdominal aneurysm .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">2/17</PHI>/94 :
The patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/18</PHI>/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Eifro Medical Center</PHI> which was evaluated with a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan .
The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/31</PHI>/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .
The patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Extremities :
are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .
Neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .
EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .
Her chest X-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .
There were no intraoperative complications .
The patient remained intubated postoperatively .
On postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .
Epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .
The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .
This was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .
Neurological consultation was obtained .
It was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .
MRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .
The patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .
She was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .
Continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .
The patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .
Additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center</PHI> .
It is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 81 year old woman with a history of hypertension , history of recurrent VPBs , admitted for investigation following a syncopal episode two weeks prior to admission .
The patient experienced a brief episode of loss of consciousness while driving her car two weeks prior to admission , at which time she collided with the car in front of her and rapidly regained consciousness .
There was no aura , no witnessed seizure activity and no post ictal symptoms .
After the syncopal episode the patient was evaluated at a local hospital with head and abdominal CT , EEG , and EKG , all of which were normal .
The patient has history of VPBs as noted above , treated with Flecainide with good symptomatic response .
Following discontinuation of this drug the patient noted return of palpitations .
Left mastectomy in 1982 for breast carcinoma .
DJD , hypertension , status post cholecystectomy , status post cataract surgery , status post herniorrhaphy .
None known .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
Vaseretic 10 mg p.o.q.d. , Calan SR 240 mg p.o.q.d. , Motrin 600 mg p.o. prn , Cytotec prn with Motrin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
She is a nonsmoker , nondrinker .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pleasant elderly lady in no apparent distress .
Blood pressure 140/70 , heart rate 84 , with occasional premature beats , respirations 16 , afebrile .
Skin :
Within normal limits .
Supple without lympadenopathy .
No JVD .
Clear .
Showed no JVD .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , without masses .
Bowel sounds present .
Cranial nerves intact .
Sensory motor examination was grossly intact .
Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout .
Hematocrit 44 , WBC count 4.9 thousand , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 thousand , potassium 3.6 , PT and PTT were within normal limits .
LFTs were normal .
It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient &apos;s episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress .
During the study , the right bundle branch was hit by the catheter , inducing a right bundle branch block .
Following this , upon rapid atrial pacing at a rate of 120 , there was revealed a bifascicular left block , which combined with the right bundle branch block caused a complete heart block .
The pacer was inserted on the fifth hospital day without event , and the patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day .
The patient is discharged home .
Followup with primary physician in one week .

ADMISSION DATE :
DISCHARGE DATE :
1. Obstructive jaundice .
3. biliary obstruction .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Therefore she was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and admitted there from <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/25</PHI> - <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/03</PHI> .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above ; appendectomy in 1916 , hysterectomy in 1941 , mastoid surgery in 1970 , shingles of right arm in 1994 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin daily .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is originally from <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Tbalt</PHI> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
temperature 98.4 , blood pressure 116/60 , pulse 76 , respirations 18 .
HEENT :
The neck was supple with shotty lymphadenopathy , 2+ carotids without bruits .
Chest :
a few bibasilar crackles ; otherwise clear to auscultation .
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 94 , bicarbonate 31 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 218 , alkaline phosphatase 634 , LDH 212 , SGOT 30 , bilirubin 0.8 direct , total bilirubin 1.2 .
Sed rate 100 .
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
clear lungs .
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
The patient &apos;s subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .
Stable .
