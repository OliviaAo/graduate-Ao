otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection .\nOf note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .\nShe was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .\nShe did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.\nShe denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .\nShe was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .\nThere was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .\nApparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to Ez Ephtro Health Center where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .\nShe was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .\nENT consult was obtained .\nENT examination was then to be performed .\nChest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :\nNone .\nALLERGIES :\nNone .\nSmoking none .\nLives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nShe had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .\nOral cavity was normal .\nNeck :\nOtherwise normal and the trachea was midline .\nThe left pyriform was obliterated by edema .\nThe right pyriform was narrowed by edema .\nThe epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .\nThe patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .\nThere was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .\nLungs :\nClear .\nHeart :\nS1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .\nAbdomen :\nSoft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .\nNo masses .\nExtremities :\nNormal .\nBack :\nShowed significant thoracic kiphosis .\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\nRevealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .\nThe chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .\nShe was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .\nDue to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .\nThe patient was sedated .\nAt the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .\nHer episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .\nShe had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .\nShe was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .\nEKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .\nShe continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .\nHer blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .\nOn 4/5/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .\nShe was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .\nOtherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .\nOf note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .\nOnce the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .\nTube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .\nAfter extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .\nO2 saturations looked good .\nIt was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .\nHer white counts came down .\nBlood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .\nShe had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .\nUnfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .\nNonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .\nDISPOSITION :\nOn 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .\nOur plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .\nShe , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .\nIf she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .\nRG556/4903 EENTO WORKS , M.D. NL6\nD :\n04/10/91\nBatch :\nReport :\n\n", "asets": [{"hasID": false, "type":
