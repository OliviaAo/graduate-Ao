PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
ALLERGIES :
Sulfonamides .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in [LOCATION]"DATE">March</PHI> , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .
Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .
Over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and [LOCATION] .
He returned for routine office evaluation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/25</PHI>/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .
Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .
The liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .
Later , an echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .
potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .
There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .
A large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .
The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .
We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wierst</PHI> and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .

A generally cachectic white male , resting quietly with his eyes closed .
His blood pressure was 140/70 , heart rate 75 .
The general medical examination was noted for bilateral temporal wasting .
The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation .
Extremities - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The discs were flat .
He responded to threat on the left , but not on the right .
The tongue was midline .
There was a right facial droop which was mild .
He had slight decreased corneal reflex on the right .
Motor - right flaccid arm and he moved his left purposefully , but did not squeeze his hands .
An erythrocyte sedimentation rate 3 , hematocrit 44 , white blood count 21.7 , lytes within normal limits .
The head computerized tomography scan without contrast showed a 3 x 3 x 5 cm. hemorrhage extending form the left Sylvian fissure and put amen to the left front oparietal lobe .
There was mass effect and some midline shift .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to then Neurologic Intensive Care Unit .
His blood pressure was not elevated .
The aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and [LOCATION] .
The medial region of the hematoma was felt to be suspicious for tumor versus arteriovenous malformation .
There was no enhancement seen in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .
Given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar mass .
This was followed up with a bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .
A cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for mass effect from the hematoma .
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and G-tube was performed at the same time .
This confirmed an 8 mm. mass which was bright on T2 and homogeneous in the right lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with a benign hemangioma or cyst .
The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .
He awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .
His Decadron has been tapered slowly to zero and his examination on discharge was as follows :
He sleeps with a hypophonia , but occasionally will speak louder when he is in better spirits .
His pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .
On repetitive testing with Speech Therapy had not been able to swallow in a safe manner .
He squints with his left eye when he tries to focus and claims this is because he sees double .
HE had an upgoing toe .
On the left , his reflexes wee 2-2+ with a downgoing toe .
Depending upon his head computerized tomography scan , he will proceed to a brain biopsy if needed .
The patient will be discharged to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Limestrict T Pio Medical Center</PHI> and will be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mo Muell</PHI> in one month in the Neurologic Clinic .

DISCHARGED TO <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">SOUTHOBASSKING&apos;S VILLEMARG HOSPITAL</PHI> .
Acute polymicrobial bacterial endocarditis .
She was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .
There was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
There was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .
She had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
Because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .
Towards the end of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .
She was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .
During her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .
She , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .
In the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .
The sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .
She was returned to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/22</[LOCATION] and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .
Her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .
With clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .
She subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .
Autopsy permission was granted .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
2. relook coronary angiogram , <PHI TYPE="DATE">08-18</PHI>-93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .
The patient was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center</PHI> and was admitted .
Her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .
The left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .
Her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury .
Her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .
The jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle .
The first sound was normal .
The examination of the extremities showed no edema .
Her electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor R-wave progression in V1 through V4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction .
There were non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-17</PHI>-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending .
Therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .
She was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08-18</PHI>-93 for a relook coronary angiography .
Coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy .
The patient remained stable during the rest of the hospitalization .
She was transferred in stable condition to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Pasi</PHI> for further rehabilitation therapy .

Her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .
In 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Times</PHI> , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .
At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .
Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .
It showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .
The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .
The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram .
The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .
On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .
We will ambulate her over the next couple of days .

The patient is disabled .
She was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated .
She was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated BUN and creatinine and failure to eat .
Her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in [LOCATION]"DATE">April</PHI> of 1997 .
She also has a history of urinary tract infection .
There was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .
She also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .
However , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .
On physical examination her pulse was 55 .
She appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .
Laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .
BUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .
A urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .
A head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .
At that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
However , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .
Her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .
A cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .
However , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .
Nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .
The patient will be transferred tomorrow to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Naplesvillechaelty</PHI> .

Recently the patient noticed hoarseness secondary to vocal cord involvement of the tumor .
He denied any shortness of breath at that time .
2) History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Hypertension .
6) Question of internal capsule CVA on CT scan .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
LABORATORY DATA :
SMA 7 was unremarkable aside from a glucose of 173 and a potassium of 3.1 .
LFTs revealed ALT of 44 , AST of 36 , LDH of 277 , alk phos 155 , total bili 0.7 , and direct bili 0.4. Total protein 7.2 , albumin 3.7 , calcium 9.3. PT and PTT were 13.3 and 23.5 respectively .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .
Other GI issues include the patient &apos;s hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .
Because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .
3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .
Several NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .
The patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .
4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .
The patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/22</PHI>/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .
No organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .
It was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .
He had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .
The patient continued to be asymptomatic .
The patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .
These issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .
8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .
The white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .
The last PT and PTT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/26</PHI>/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .
The last UA and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/27</PHI>/93 .
3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .
Pepcid 20 mg po IV b.i.d. for history of gastritis and GI bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. ( this may be discontinued as the patient becomes more mobile and active ) , tube feeds with Jevity at 75 cc / hour full strength-please check residuals .

DEATH
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Epogen and Vitamin B 12 injections .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
Soft , slightly distended , nontender .
No hernias .
The patient did have right costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .
There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .
There was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of [LOCATION] .
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .
The Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .
Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .
In the abdomen the patient &apos;s retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled-off .
He was hydrated vigorously .
This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .
The patient &apos;s urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .

He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Huyychestleme Health Of</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Scoo , Utah</PHI> where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
5) Chronically low platelet count .
7) Hypothyroidism .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Married to a very supportive wife .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Cardiac exam was regular S1 and S2 , no murmur .
Chest clear to auscultation with a few fine crackles at the left base .
Rectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing [LOCATION] toes bilaterally .
PT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .
Chest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/28</PHI>/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .

NAME :
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of [LOCATION]s disease x &apos;s 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall .
He has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications .
MEDICATIONS ; On admission were Eldepryl , Artane , Prilodol , Sinemet and Opuputine .
A head CT was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .
Head CT results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Factor</PHI> agreed he would review the CTs and follow the patient while in house .
He was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .
The patient &apos;s mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">[LOCATION]/PHI> services .
He again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .
He was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .
An electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased ST segment and left anterior ST depressions .
A chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .
He had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .
He was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .
He was diuresed with [LOCATION] and [LOCATION] and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated .
He surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .
His neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .
The lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .

Nephrocaps , 1 q.day , Colace 1 q.day , Allopurinol 100 q.day , Verapamil 240 mg q.day , Niferex 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Colchicine 0.6 mg PO q.day , Phoslo 667 mg q.day , Cardura 1 mg PO q.day .
Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .
The patient was admitted to the hospital on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-8</PHI>-94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here-transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the <PHI TYPE="ID">EXWAGH9T</PHI> protocol .
His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .
He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .
An X-ray at the time revealed free air .
He therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with [LOCATION] pouch creation and ileostomy creation .
At the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .
An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .
A Holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .
The patient was seen in consultation and evaluated by Cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , Propanolol , and verapamil .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">5/19</PHI>/95 at 3:15 a.m.
He has a long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy , presumably due to alcohol .
He has also had atrial fibrillation since 1990 , which has been rate controlled on Digoxin .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Adenocarcinoma of the colon .
Cirrhosis .
Cipro 250 mg. b.i.d.
Sulfa medications .
Blood pressure was 104/66 .
Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air .
He continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator .
His status , however , remained volatile , and in keeping his volume status somewhat on the dry side to optimize his pulmonary status , he became relatively oliguric and hypernatremic .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/15</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Angio Suite for an attempted transhepatic internal jugular porta caval shunt .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/17</PHI> , he spiked a temperature to 103 with rigors and shaking chills .
His respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently .
A Swan-Ganz catheter revealed an SVR of 350 , and he was started on Neo-Synephrine and Epinephrine prior to the Do Not Resuscitate order .
He was pronounced dead at 3:15 a.m.

ADMISSION DATE :
2. Primary malignant neoplasm of the breast ( resected ) .
5. Deconditioning .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
She had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness .
She did look mildly dyspneic .
Her lungs were clear .
The rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Her ALT 11 , her AST slightly up at 59 .
Hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets 345,0000 .
A CA 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .
The patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of Zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .
This was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site .
A single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain .
The sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks .
PLAN :
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Tylenol 1-2 tabs q.4 p.r.n. pain .
Fragmin 5000 units subq b.i.d. Oxycodone controlled-release ( OxyContin ) 10 mg p.o. q.12 hours .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
<PHI TYPE="ID">585-28-96</PHI>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with [LOCATION] &apos;s disease or features consistent with [LOCATION] .
This was poorly responsive to [LOCATION] .
There was no definite clonic activity .
There was no known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .
no known drug allergies .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
5) hypertension .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
He lives with his wife who is his primary care giver .
He is a former professor at <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</PHI> .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Lungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Extremities :
Neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice .
His pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left .
He had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace .
SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
There was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
Stable .

PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION FOR LYMPHOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Significant for hypertension .
On admission revealed the patient to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 80 .
Respirations were 16 .
Cardiac exam was normal .
The remainder of his physical examination was normal except for decreased vibration and position sense in the distal fingers and toes .
The remainder of his laboratory studies were normal .
The patient underwent conditioning with Cytoxan , VP-16 , and [LOCATION] .
His initial hospital course was complicated by the following :
The patient developed fever and neutropenia without any clear source .
Starting on approximately day 14 , the patient developed signs of renal occlusive disease with increasing bilirubin .
This progressed inexorably until he developed massive ascites and marked hyperbilirubinemia .
Despite aggressive supportive care , the patient &apos;s liver pathology did not resolve and he continued to have progressive hepatic failure .
Despite maximal efforts with coloids , renal range dopamine and [LOCATION] , the patient &apos;s creatinine continued to rise .
4. Respiratory :
Because of mechanical limitations imposed by his ascites , the patient had severe tachypnea and required supplemental oxygen to maintain his oxygenation .

End-stage renal disease .
2. Cadaveric renal transplant .
3. Acute thrombosis .
6. Hypertension .
7. Coronary artery disease .
9. Hypercoagulable state .
The patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/16</PHI>/98 .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/04</PHI>/94 .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .
Consequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .
At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .
Dring this hospitalization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hahkellrick Hospital</PHI> , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .
She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation .
The patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .
Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient &apos;s hospitalization without difficulty .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">09/23</PHI>/98
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay Memorial Hospital Of</PHI> for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .
He was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/2</PHI>/98 he was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay Memorial Hospital Of</PHI> with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .
He was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .
He continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation and management .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin .
ALLERGIES :
He reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .
However , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .
He was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .
There was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .
Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .
His hematocrit was 49.3 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .
He had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .
He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .
In following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .
His Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .
His INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .
Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .
Given his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .
He will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">[LOCATION]/PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> as well as Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lupevickette Folk</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Dwainco Rallsversgach</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Villean Garl</PHI> .

EPIGLOTTITIS .
Of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .
She did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
He recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .
She presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .
She was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .
She was febrile to 101.7 .
Negative .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
None .
Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Neck :
Otherwise normal and the trachea was midline .
The right pyriform was narrowed by edema .
There was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .
Extremities :
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
She was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
At the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .
Her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
She had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .
She was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .
She went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/5</PHI>/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .
Tube feedings were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/3</PHI>/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/5</PHI>/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .
After extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
It was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .
She had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .
Nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of [LOCATION] and had no further problems with her heart .
Her mental status began to clear under the family &apos;s request .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 1994 patient developed 2-3 months of headaches , cognitive changes , dizziness and memory loss .
However , the patient developed left IIIrd nerve palsy and an MRI showed increasing lesion in the left ______________ cerebral peduncle and the left mid brain .
The patient was reinduced with high dose methotrexate , 8 mg / meter sq. with some initial tumor response .
At that point , the patient was switched over toe high-dose ARA-C ( 2.5 gm / meter sq ) .
The patient was recently discharged from the hospital after her second cycle of high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy .
The patient remained stable to the last few days prior to admission when she developed insidious rectal bleeding , probably from her external hemorrhoids , along with decreasing platelet count .
white blood count 5,000 , hematocrit 38 , platelet count 50,000 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 27</PHI> , white blood count 1.6 , hematocrit 28.9 , platelet count 28,000 :
The patient developed substernal chest pain without radiation on the night of admission .
The patient was given 2 units of packed RBC along with the six units of platelet transfusion .
The patient &apos;s symptoms improved with the above measures and the patient no longer complained of chest pain during the hospitalization .
The patient &apos;s hemoglobin improved to 10.0 after the transfusion and her rectal bleeding apparently stopped .
A GI consultation was made and they felt that the rectal bleeding is most likely from the hemorrhoids and no further intervention was felt to be necessary .
The patient had a follow up MRI scan which showed no significant change of tumor mass .
Decadron 6 mg po tid ; and she should continue Inderal , Synthroid and Zoloft at the present dose and frequency .
The patient was instructed to call us with any clinical or neurological symptoms .

He was treated at that time with TPA .
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
His most recent admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> is on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 5</PHI> , of 1994 .
His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .
There is no history of drug abuse or smoking .
His jugular venous pressure was normal .
His abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .
Glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .
His hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .
the primary concern upon Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .
The left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .
After an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
Because of the ongoing nature of his pain .
He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .
His anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .
His APC resistance was normal .
Rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
Because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .
That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .
That was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .
After extended discussions with pain service , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> was brought back down to the pain clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 27</PHI> .
There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .
Therefore , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 27</PHI> , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aalv Sctroi</PHI> .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">2/17</PHI>/94 :
She was subsequently referred to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riode Zetllille</PHI> for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .
The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/31</PHI>/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .
are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .
Is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .
EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .
The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient &apos;s procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .
The patient remained intubated postoperatively .
She had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .
The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .
Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .
The patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .
She was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .
The patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .
She was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .
Is satisfactory .
During this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Lopressor 25 mg PO b.i.d. , Dulcolax tablets 2 PO q.a.m. , Dulcolax suppository 1 PO q.o.d. , digoxin .125 mg PO q. day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. , Tylenol 650 mg PO / PR q. 4 hours p.r.n. elevated temperature , Benadryl 25-50 PO q.h.s. and [LOCATION] 1-2 tablets PO q. 4 hours p.r.n. pain .

Gastric outlet obstruction .
2. metastatic adenocarcinoma to the liver .
Gastrojejunostomy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/08</PHI>/94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a <PHI TYPE="AGE">111y</PHI> year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/01</PHI> complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
The stones were then removed .
Approximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of 15 lb , and nausea and vomiting .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
She was admitted for workup of her symptoms .
ALLERGIES :
Her mother died of an unspecified tumor .
Vital signs :
regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
no masses , lesions or nipple discharge .
White count 13.8 , hematocrit 33 , platelet count 353,000 .
Sed rate 100 .
PT 11.8 , PTT 23.9 .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .
