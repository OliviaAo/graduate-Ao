2. PULMONARY CONGESTION .
Unsigned
Report Status :
Unsigned
DISCHARGE DATE :
<DATE>5/12/92</DATE>
DIAGNOSIS :
1. Sick sinus syndrome .
2. Pulmonary congestion .
3. Status post mitral valve replacement , with a porcine valve , and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery .
4. Chronic obstructive lung disease .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Zestril , 10 , b.i.d. , coumadin , to be regulated , digoxin , 0.125 mg. , alternating with 0.25 , every other day , verapamil , 80 , 4 times a day , Asthmacort , four puffs , b.i.d. , Atrovent , 2 puffs , 4 times a day , and quinine sulfate , 325 , q.h.s.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on <DATE>10/28/76</DATE> by Dr. <DOCTOR>Melvean Ace</DOCTOR> .
She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. &apos;s .
She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .
She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.
She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .
She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .
Dr. <DOCTOR>Avejoh Wierst</DOCTOR> at the <HOSPITAL>Pedines Community Hospital</HOSPITAL> found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .
A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .
Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the <HOSPITAL>Bri Health</HOSPITAL> for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .
The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .
This was on diltiazem and digoxin .
Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .
We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .
She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .
Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on <DATE>5/4</DATE> , and diltiazem was restarted .
A cardiac catheterization was carried out on <DATE>5/5</DATE> , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .
There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .
Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .
With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .
A permanent pacemaker was put in on <DATE>5/6/92</DATE> .
This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
She tolerated the procedure well .
On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .
We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .
If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. <DOCTOR>Avejoh Wierst</DOCTOR> and Dr. <DOCTOR>Em Neighburce</DOCTOR> .
