<PATIENT>Daie Elms</PATIENT> was a 50-year-old male , who underwent cadaveric renal transplant in 1992 , who presented with a three-week old scrape of the right popliteal fossa related to a prosthesis .
The wound became progressively indurated with drainage , and he presented for evaluation and treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Prednisone .
Procardia .
Pravachol .
Imuran .
Epogen .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an obese man in no acute distress .
His blood pressure was 174/60 ; temperature 103.4 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination was remarkable for poor dentition .
The neck was supple without adenopathy .
The chest examination was remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally , with regular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and obese .
The genitourinary examination was notable for a suprapubic tube in place with normal male genitalia and guaiac negative stools on rectal examination .
Extremity examination revealed bilateral below-knee amputations with a 2 x 4 centimeter area of inflammation in the right popliteal fossa with a draining sinus .
LABORATORY DATA :
At the time of admission , BUN and creatinine were 89 and 4.4 ; white blood count 19.3 ; hematocrit 21.9 ; PT 15.1 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Cultures from his abdomen subsequently grew out methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
His nutrition remained poor throughout this time in spite of numerous attempts at enteral alimentation .
On <DATE>11/26/96</DATE> , the patient had a hypotensive bradycardic arrest at the end of a dialysis run .
He became increasingly more unresponsive and remained quite septic and febrile , resistant to aggressive antibiotic treatment .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
He continued to deteriorate until <DATE>12/3/96</DATE> , at which time he became bradycardic and asystolic .
He had no spontaneous cardiac or neurologic activity at this time , and he was declared dead at 12:15 A.M. on <DATE>12/3/96</DATE> .
The family was notified , but declined a postmortem examination .
