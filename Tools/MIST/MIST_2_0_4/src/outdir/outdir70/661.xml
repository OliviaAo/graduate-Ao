POST-INFARCTION UNSTABLE ANGINA PECTORIS .
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
<DATE>3-26-93</DATE>
DISCHARGE DATE :
<DATE>4-3-93</DATE>
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Inferior wall myocardial infarction , ventricular fibrillation arrest , congestive heart failure , paroxysmal atrial tachycardia , coronary artery disease , psychosis .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
<DATE>3-27-93</DATE> , cardiac catheterization and coronary and left ventricular angiography ; <DATE>4-2-93</DATE> , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Vasotec 5 mg PO b.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg PO q.i.d. , Ticlopidine 50 mg PO b.i.d. , Metoprolol 50 mg PO b.i.d. , Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO q12h x seven days , nitroglycerin 0.3 mg sublingually prn chest pain .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 73 year old female who was transferred for cardiac catheterization after ventricular fibrillation arrest in the setting of an acute inferior myocardial infarction and a urinary tract infection .
The patient was readmitted on <DATE>3-20-93</DATE> because of fever , chills and a sudden onset of ventricular fibrillation arrest , successfully cardioverted back to rapid atrial fibrillation and finally to sinus rhythm , where an electrocardiogram then showed ST elevation in inferior leads .
Peak CPK was 2494 with 18% MB &apos;s .
She required intubation for mild to moderate congestive heart failure , treated with diuretics , intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin .
She had post-infarction angina , was transferred here for angiography and possible percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , blood pressure is 130/80 , pulse 74 and regular , respirations 14 .
Her chest demonstrated bibasilar crackles .
Cardiovascular exam :
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 was normally split .
The abdomen was benign , unremarkable .
Extremities :
no calf tenderness or peripheral edema .
Peripheral pulses were 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally .
On <DATE>3-27-93</DATE> , patient underwent cardiac catheterization , coronary and left ventricular angiography without complications .
Review of these angiograms demonstrated a dominant right coronary artery with a focal 50% stenosis in the mid-portion .
The left anterior descending had moderate plaques with a 50% proximal stenosis of the right anterior oblique caudal view .
The proximal diagonal D1 had a 50% stenosis .
The circumflex had a long 30% stenosis proximally and an 80% stenosis at the origin of the second major marginal artery .
The left ventricular angiogram showed akinesis of the posterobasal walls , severe hypokinesis of the diaphragmatic wall and trace mitral regurgitation .
The patient was maintained on heparin anticoagulation .
An exercise tolerance test with Thallium was to be performed in order to assess myocardial viability in the infarct zone .
The right coronary artery lesion was complex and there was severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal 1 .
The patient had no further angina .
The thallium images showed a large region of persistently reduced blood flow involving the apex and inferoposterior segments of the left ventricular wall .
This was consistent with scar .
There was no definite perfusion abnormality in the circumflex zone .
In view of these findings , it was elected to discharge her on her present medical program .
