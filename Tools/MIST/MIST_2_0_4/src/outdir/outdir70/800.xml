<DATE>07/30/93</DATE> :
bilateral coronary angiography .
<DATE>08/02/93</DATE> :
The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. <DOCTOR>Laymie Fournier</DOCTOR> and Dr. <DOCTOR>Leebjescobe</DOCTOR> in <LOCATION>Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia</LOCATION> who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in <DATE>May 1992</DATE> , at which time he was hospitalized at <HOSPITAL>Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .
A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He has a family history of hypertension as well .
A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
A thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Lungs clear .
Carotids normal .
Loud S4 and a II / VI regurgitant murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 243 .
Cholesterol 197 , triglycerides 118 , HDL 31 , LDL 142 , total protein 6.2 , bilirubin 1.0 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , SGOT 23 .
Hematocrit on admission was 43% with a white blood count of 6600 .
MCV was 85 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This lowered with IV nitroglycerin .
Selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .
He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
The situation was reviewed with his wife , <PATIENT>Sligh</PATIENT> .
She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the <LOCATION>Leigh</LOCATION> and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .
He developed epigastric pain on <DATE>07/31</DATE> which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .
On <DATE>08/02/93</DATE> , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. <DOCTOR>Thorebreutz</DOCTOR> took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. <DOCTOR>Ryna Jescdrig</DOCTOR> .
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He had good hemodynamics .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On <DATE>08/05</DATE> it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .
He had a right bundle branch block .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in <LOCATION>Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew</LOCATION> .
