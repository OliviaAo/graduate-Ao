HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .
She was in her usual state of health until <DATE>6/15/93</DATE> when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .
There were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .
Because of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to <HOSPITAL>O Center</HOSPITAL> in <LOCATION>Sondibrid Ey</LOCATION> on <DATE>6/20</DATE> , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
Her antibiotics were appropriately changed .
At the family &apos;s request , the patient was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</HOSPITAL> for further evaluation .
Further evaluation at <HOSPITAL>Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</HOSPITAL> , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
She was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .
The patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .
She was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .
In addition , she was evaluated by the <HOSPITAL>Sileyer Medical Center</HOSPITAL> and there was no evidence of active dental infection .
Her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .
A rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .
On <DATE>7/13</DATE> , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .
After considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .
Also , no source for sepsis had been found .
Accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on <DATE>7/21/93</DATE> .
Her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .
It was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .
Her valve was replaced with a St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
She remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .
After consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on <DATE>07/26/93</DATE> at 11:10 a.m.
<DATE>07/27/93</DATE>
