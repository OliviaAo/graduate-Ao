DISCHARGE SUMMARY <ID>AZI01HL</ID>
DISCHARGE SUMMARY
<PATIENT>TLANDSEUSS , CHERE C</PATIENT>
UNIT NUMBER :
<ID>083-97-79</ID>
ADMISSION DATE :
<DATE>09/15/1998</DATE>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Wolfe-Parkinson White Syndrome .
Atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
His cardiac risk factors include :
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of chest pain and in <DATE>January 1993</DATE> underwent a cardiac catheterization at <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .
He subsequently had an echocardiogram in <DATE>December 1994</DATE> which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .
He subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in <DATE>February 1997</DATE> which was negative for ischemia or infarction .
In <DATE>December 1994</DATE> he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .
He was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .
He underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. <DOCTOR>Slusslashgodle</DOCTOR> which were unsuccessful .
He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
He was discharged home but returned on <DATE>9/13/98</DATE> with worsening palpitations on and off .
He denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .
Sotalol 160 mg bid .
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
NPH and CZI insulin .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
Lisinopril 10 mg bid .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
There was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
His lungs were clear throughout .
His apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .
His abdomen was benign .
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .
His creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .
His electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .
There were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .
Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .
His initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .
He was seen by <HOSPITAL>Nnoatal Hospital Center</HOSPITAL> who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .
Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on <DATE>9/17/98</DATE> which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .
His right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .
His left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .
The patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on <DATE>9/20/98</DATE> .
There was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .
Mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .
Radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .
There were no complications .
Following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .
There were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .
He also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .
Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .
After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .
Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .
Accordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .
He did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition on <DATE>9/23/98</DATE> .
He will have a visiting nurse to see him on <LOCATION>Iat</LOCATION> .
FOLLOW-UP :
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Sotalol 120 mg bid .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
Ecotrin 1 qd ( on hold until off of Coumadin ) .
Coumadin 5 mg qhs or as directed for four weeks .
Oxybutynin 5 mg qd .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
