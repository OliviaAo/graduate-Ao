ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Lasix 40 mg. b.i.d. Tagamet 400 mg. b.i.d. Lisinopril 10 mg. q. day .
Digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day .

His chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one-halfway up the chest .
His abdomen was soft and nontender with a positive fluid wave and a liver edge 3 cm. below the costal margin .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the Medicine Service and diuresed with Lasix and started on Captopril with the Lisinopril discontinued .
After aggressive diuresis on the Medical Service , he was deemed stable for surgery .
After many discussions between Dr. <DOCTOR>Leickgrend</DOCTOR> , the patient , and his family , concerning the severely high risk , given the patient &apos;s conditions , it was decided to proceed with the operation .
On <DATE>4/27/95</DATE> , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .

He required some fluid boluses with D-5-W to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance .
On <DATE>5/14/95</DATE> , he returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for very aggressive pulmonary toilet .
His portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm. , going from 26 to 23 , so no shunt was placed .
