Report Status :
Signed Discharge
Date :
Mr. <PATIENT>Tennis</PATIENT> is a 65-year-old , white male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was admitted to the <HOSPITAL>Utal Health</HOSPITAL> in <DATE>12/92</DATE> for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by Dr. <DOCTOR>Kennedy</DOCTOR> with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to OM of the left circumflex .
The vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality .
In the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with Procainamide .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. <DOCTOR>Carbon</DOCTOR> , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
His Procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on Amiodarone .
However , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .
He took Nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms .
He came to the Emergency Room for evaluation .
In the Emergency Room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% O2 saturation .
He was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .
Iron deficiency anemia .
Hypertension .
Urosepsis in 1982 .
Peptic ulcer disease , resulting in gastrectomy .
A 2.5-cm. abdominal aortic aneurysm which was recently sizedat 3.5 cm .
Smoker for greater than 100 pack years ( 3-1/2 packs per day x 35 years ) .
No ethanol history .
Otherwise nonfocal .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Digoxin 0.25 mg. p.o. q. a.m. Coumadin 7.5 mg. p.o. q. d. Captopril 25 mg. p.o. q.i.d. Lasix 160 mg. in the morning and 80 mg. at night .
Isordil 10 mg. p.o. t.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure was 154/90 in the right and 150/82 in the left .
Pulse was varying between 120 and 140 .
He was afebrile .
His respiratory rate was 20 .
He had a furrowed tongue , but hisoropharynx was otherwise negative .
Cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate .
The PMI was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .
Heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .
An S2 split was not appreciated .
There were no murmurs .
Chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .
Abdominal exam revealed surgical scars and questionable hepatojugular reflux .
Liver was 10 cm. in width , 2 to 3 cm. below the rib .
Rectal exam was heme negative .
Extremities were warm with good distal pulses .
Neurologic exam was non focal .
Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were normal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Digoxin level was 1.3 .
The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable P-R interval , QRS of 0.09 , and QTC of 0.42 .
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
He was loaded on Amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed .
A right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 .
The ejection fraction was not calculated .
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no EKG changes during these episodes .
On <DATE>3/22</DATE> , after an appropriate load of Amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .
He was reloaded back upon Coumadin and reached a therapeutic INR .
He was discharged on <DATE>March 24th</DATE> with follow-up of his PT / PTT values on Friday , the <DATE>25th</DATE> , as well as three times a week in the following week , and follow-up with Dr. <DOCTOR>Most</DOCTOR> within two weeks .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Amiodarone 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for the first two weeks , decreasing to 200 mg. p.o. q.d. in the subsequent time .
