The patient was subsequently medically management after this hospitalization and has done very well .
His most recent echocardiogram in <DATE>April of 1996</DATE> showed an ejection fraction of 20% with a thin fibrotic septum with akinesis and moderately severe hypokinesis in all other regions except for the lateral wall .
The patient also had an electrocardiogram in <DATE>April of 1996</DATE> which was negative following , however was at a low workload .

Given his high right-sided filling pressure , he was started on Lasix for diuresis and his Captopril was increased for greater afterload reduction .
It was felt that the patient should have an augmented medical regimen and as an outpatient undergo an exercise tolerance test with viability evaluation to determine whether he would benefit from revascularization .
