Ms. <PATIENT>Rule</PATIENT> is a 75 year old woman who is status post sigmoid resection for Duke &apos;s C2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on <DATE>7/8/96</DATE> with abdominal pain and neutropenia .
She first presented in <DATE>April of 1990</DATE> with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke &apos;s B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .
She then represented in <DATE>March of 1996</DATE> with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .
She underwent a sigmoid resection on <DATE>5/17/96</DATE> by Dr. <DOCTOR>Lenni Pain</DOCTOR> .
Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .
One of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .
She was therefore staged Dukes C2 .
An abdominal CT scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .
A chest x-ray was read as clear .
She is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .
She began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .
She was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of Dr. <DOCTOR>Aacent Slentjae</DOCTOR> of the <HOSPITAL>Linatpromehack Worth Hospital</HOSPITAL> for Radiation Therapy .
She began treatment on <DATE>6/20/96</DATE> .
Her course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of <DATE>June</DATE> .
An MRI was performed on <DATE>6/25/96</DATE> to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .
She presented to the <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> Emergency Room on <DATE>7/8/96</DATE> with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .
She denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in 1992.
(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .
Cardiac catheterization showed sequential LAD and she underwent angioplasty twice to the LAD with good results .
An echocardiogram in <DATE>June of 1994</DATE> showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% .
Her baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block .
(4) Osteoporosis .
(5) Hypercholesterolemia .
(7) Status post appendectomy .
(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service under the care of Dr. <DOCTOR>Lenni Pain</DOCTOR> .
Her abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .
An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .
However , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .
These findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .
She was admitted and made NPO .
She was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
Her ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .
She was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .
She was also placed on neutropenic precautions .
However , repeated abdominal x-rays and CT scans continued to show no signs of obstruction or perforation .
However , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .
By <DATE>7/15/96</DATE> she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .
Of note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .
Of note , shortly after starting on her TPN her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and TPN was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .
She was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
We recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .
During this time she will continue to receive TPN .
After that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .
Her small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Insulin sliding scale b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day , Neutra-phos 500 mg p.o. q. day , metopromide 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets one sublingually q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , nizatidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea , nafcillin dose 4 mg in 24 hours , and TPN .
