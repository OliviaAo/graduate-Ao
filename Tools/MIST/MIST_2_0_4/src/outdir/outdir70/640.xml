HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient developed hematemesis <DATE>November 15th</DATE> and was intubated for respiratory distress .
He was transferred to the <HOSPITAL>Valtawnprinceel Community Memorial Hospital</HOSPITAL> for endoscopy and esophagoscopy on the <DATE>16th of November</DATE> which showed a 2 cm linear tear of the esophagus at 30 to 32 cm .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was stable and he was given no further intervention .
The patient attempted a gastrografin swallow on the <DATE>21st</DATE> , but was unable to cooperate with probable aspiration .
The patient also had been receiving generous intravenous hydration during the period for which he was NPO for his esophageal tear and intravenous Lasix for a question of pulmonary congestion .
On the morning of the <DATE>22nd</DATE> the patient developed tachypnea with a chest X-ray showing a question of congestive heart failure .
A medical consult was obtained at the <HOSPITAL>Valtawnprinceel Community Memorial Hospital</HOSPITAL> .
The patient was given intravenous Lasix .
A arterial blood gases on 100 percent face mask showed an oxygen of 205 , CO2 57 and PH 7.3 .
An electrocardiogram showed ST depressions in V2 through V4 which improved with sublingual and intravenous nitroglycerin .
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for management of his congestive heart failure , ischemia and probable aspiration pneumonia .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. coronary artery disease .
2. non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
4. history of cholecystectomy .
The patient &apos;s medications at home were Micronase , Isordil and aspirin .
8. SOCIAL HISTORY :
He is a former alcoholic , but without any alcohol in 30 years prior to admission .
He is legally blind .
On physical examination he is a tachypneic white male on 40 percent face mask with oxygen saturations 98 percent .
Blood pressure 150/60 , heart rate 90 &apos;s , respirations 22 .
His oropharynx was clear .
He had no gag .
He did count fingers in both eyes at one foot .
He had 2+ carotids on time without bruits .
His heart rate was regular rate and rhythm .
He had diffuse rhonchi and upper airway noises .
His abdomen was benign .
He had guaiac positive brown stool with a normal prostate .
His neurological examination was remarkable for a mildly encephalopathic male .
He was oriented times two .
He moved extremities times four .
His reflexes were 2+ and symmetric .
His toes were down going .
LABORATORY DATA :
Four liter arterial blood gas of 71/43/7.45 , ionized calcium 1.03 , normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine 16/1.4 , glucose 246 , calc , mag and phos normal , albumin 2.2 , LDH 227 , liver function tests normal , white count 10.6 , hematocrit 32 which was 31 on the 19th and 38 on the 16th , prothrombin time 9.9 , partial thromboplastin time 26 .
A sputum gram stain showed moderate polys with few gram negative rods .
A chest X-ray showed bilateral opacities in the bases with increased interstitial markings .
An electrocardiogram on admission to the CCU showed normal sinus , 90 beats per minute , with a normal axis , normal intervals , an old inferior myocardial infarction and up sloping ST depressions with V2 to V4 with increased rate .
These improved with decreased rate .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was also placed on intravenous nitroglycerin , oxygen and aspirin for his coronary ischemia .
No heparin was given because of his esophageal laceration .
No beta blocker was given because of his history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
The patient remained stable in the Coronary Care Unit and was transferred to the floor on the <DATE>23rd</DATE> on aspirin , Carafate , intravenous Haldol , nebs , Unasyn , NPH with CZI sliding coverage , morphine , Compazine and intravenous Benadryl .
His blood gas at that time on 40 percent face mask was 84 , 42 , 7.48 .
His hematocrit was 28 at the time of transfer .
He was still guaiac positive at that time .
His mental status was improved from admission to the CCU .
The patient did well on the floor initially with improvement in his arterial blood gases and mental status .
However , on the <DATE>24th</DATE> he had a massive upper GI bleed .
He was taken for esophagogastroduodenoscopy by the Surgical Service after elective intubation for airway control .
The clot was dense despite multiple attempts at lavage .
There was no lesion noted in the stomach .
The pylorus was entered and the first and second portion of the duodenum were inspected and were seen to be normal .
It was felt the patient &apos;s GI bleeding was secondary to his previously known esophageal tear .
He was readmitted to the Coronary Care Unit on the <DATE>25th</DATE> , where initially he was stable .
His aspirin was discontinued .
He was continued on the intravenous Cimetidine and Carafate except that he was made NPO .
He was seen in consultation by the <HOSPITAL>OLH</HOSPITAL> Service , who felt he was a candidate for total parenteral nutrition .
On the <DATE>25th</DATE> he developed progressive hypotension with evidence of further upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
An electrocardiogram at that time showed a right rate related right bundle and apical ST changes consistent with ischemia .
Repeat endoscopy was unsuccessful because of severe bleeding despite massive lavage .
Three sites of active extravasation were found , one from the gastroesophageal junction area and two from the gastric fundus .
He was continued to be intubated with poor mental status .
He was paralyzed for the vascular procedure .
Given the multi organ system failure on the <DATE>26th</DATE> the family was consulted regarding his dismal prognosis and they decided to make the patient do not resuscitate without further pressures or aggressive measures with comfort care being paramount .
The patient continued to have bleeding with progressive downward deterioration of his mental status and renal failure and temperature spikes .
The patient died on the <DATE>31st</DATE> .
