EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 107 beats per minute .
Large left ventricle , bilateral atelectasis or effusion .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan :
Pancreatitis , fluid collection in the lesser sac .
Gallbladder was visualized with stones .
The patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .
He was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
The fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .
On <DATE>4/28/95</DATE> , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on <DATE>4/27</DATE> .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
Approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
He remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .
Mr. <PATIENT>Mass</PATIENT> was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on <DATE>07/15/95</DATE> .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
By the end of <DATE>June</DATE> , it became clear that Mr. <PATIENT>Mass</PATIENT> would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .
After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <DOCTOR>Douet</DOCTOR> at <HOSPITAL>Vassdiysey Medical Center</HOSPITAL> , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to <HOSPITAL>Vassdiysey Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
