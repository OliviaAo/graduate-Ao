DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
ASCENDING AORTIC DISSECTION PROCEDURE PERFORMED :
Ms. <PATIENT>List</PATIENT> is a 67 year-old diabetic woman with a known thoracic aortic dissection .
On <DATE>December 29 , 1996</DATE> , the patient developed abdominal and back pain and presented to <HOSPITAL>Drain Hospital</HOSPITAL> .
A dissected descending thoracic aorta was diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiogram .
The patient was transferred to <HOSPITAL>En&apos;s Healthcare</HOSPITAL> for work-up .
She was intubated with pulmonary edema and followed by serial examinations .
<DATE>January 2</DATE> CT scan of the chest showed a type III descending thoracic aortic aneurysm beginning distal to the left subclavian artery and ending above the renal artery .
<DATE>January 4</DATE> , a CT scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , parenchymal consolidation right greater than left , aortic dissection with true and false lumens , well delineated flap with compression of the true lumen secondary to mass effect of thrombus in the false lumen .
There was a mediastinal hematoma .
<DATE>January 23 , 1996</DATE> , the patient had a CT scan , again showing ascending aorta with low density abnormality , with findings suspicious for involvement of the ascending aorta by dissection , bilateral pleural effusions were improved .
The patient reports having been hospitalized for approximately one month , at which time she was discharged to a nursing home after refusing surgery .
The patient has had dyspnea on exertion since <DATE>January , 1996</DATE> , increasing in the last month , and increasing abdominal distention .
The patient denies history of myocardial infarction or chest pain .
She does have shortness of breath and pedal edema .
She has had atrial fibrillation for five years .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She does orthopnea of three to four pillows .
The patient underwent CT scan on <DATE>Jul 24 , 1997</DATE> , which demonstrated dissection of the ascending and archaorta to the root .
CT scan also demonstrated stable descending thoracic dissection with resolution of luminal compression .
Congestive heart failure .
Atrial fibrillation .
Hypertension .
Hiatal hernia .
History of gastrointestinal bleed on aspirin .
Status post appendectomy .
Status post umbilical hernia repair .
Status postventral hernia repair .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
History of 40 pack years smoking , quit in <DATE>December , 1996</DATE> .
Occasional ethanol .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfa , which gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS :
She is in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with irregular heart rate at 96 .
Blood pressure is 138/72 .
She is on room air at 90% .
Oropharynx showed poor dentition with apparent decay of the remaining teeth and gum recession .
The lungs demonstrated wheezes on auscultation with crackles at the bases .
Cardiovascular was irregularly irregular rhythm and rate .
Holosystolic murmur , II / VI , at the left lower sternal border .
The abdomen was obese , protuberant , nontender with well-healed surgical scars .
Extremities showed no clubbing or cyanosis .
Varicosities particularly left lower extremity front and back and right upper extremity medially .
There were 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally , 2+ radial pulses bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
Significant for white blood cell count of 6.8. BUN 14 , creatinine 1 .
Urinalysis was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for preoperative work-up prior to planned repair of her ascending aortic dissection .
The patient was evaluated by the Dental Service , who felt that it was necessary to extract several teeth and to follow several more , specifically tooth 15 and 16 , that were fully impacted .
The patient received periprocedure antibiotics .
The patient underwent echocardiogram on <DATE>Jul 25 , 1997</DATE> , demonstrating 2/4+ tricuspid regurgitation with a peak velocity of 2.9 ; mitral regurgitation 2/4 , mild concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle ; no systolic function with mild septal hypokinesis .
The ejection fraction was estimated at 55% .
The aortic valve appeared sclerotic with mild to moderate insufficiency .
Dissection flap was noted .
There was pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 34 mmHg plus right atrial pressure .
There was also evidence of a secundum type atrioseptal defect , approximately 0.5 centimeters in size , with elevated right atrial pressure .
The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization on <DATE>Jul 25 , 1997</DATE> , demonstrating elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 19 , right ventricular pressure of 56/19 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/39 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24/26/21 .
Non selective coronary arteriography performed did not reveal the presence of any focal coronary artery disease .
The aortic root angiography revealed the presence of an extensive ascending aortic dissection .
True lumen could not be accessed from either the left or right femoral artery .
The true lumen required access by right radial artery and tortuous innominate artery .
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on <DATE>Jul 26 , 1997</DATE> , where she underwent resection and repair of chronic aortic dissection and reconstruction of the super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 as well as primary repair of an atrioseptal defect which appeared consistent with a patent foramen ovale and was 1-2 centimeters insize .
On postoperative day number one , however , the patient was hemodynamically stable on a small amount of heparin and nitroglycerin with a cardiac index of 3 .
The patient required diuresis in her course after receiving multiple blood products .
Beta blocker was started as well .
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number three .
She did demonstrate evidence of a right brachial neuropathy , likely associated with the extensive dissection required for access to the right axillary artery , given the patient &apos;s distorted anatomy due to the large dissection .
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and received therapy to the right upper extremity and hand .
She will require continued therapy .
Otherwise the patient was neurologically intact .
The determination was made not to Coumadinize the patient given herchronic descending thoracic dissection and history of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient has been chronically in atrial fibrillation preoperatively without Coumadin therapy .
The patient did require extensive pulmonary toilet and she continues to benefit from nebulizer therapy , chest physiotherapy and diuresis .
Her chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated bilateral small effusions , right greater than left .
On 2 liters nasal cannulaoxygen , she is saturating at 93-95% .
The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation for reconditioning in general and specifically in regard to her right upper extremity .
