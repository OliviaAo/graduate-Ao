PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Mitral valve disease .
Atrial fibrillation , hypertension , aortic valve disease , family history of coronary artery disease , hypothyroidism , and tobacco use .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
Right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography , and left ventriculogram .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 83-year-old woman under the care of Dr. <DOCTOR>Lenni Be</DOCTOR> with a diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis .
She had a history of increasing dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath , orthopnea , and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
In addition , she noted palpitations but had a negative Holter monitor for tachy arrhythmias .
She is currently New York Heart Association functional class 3 .
A 2D echocardiogram showed mitral stenosis with a peak gradient of 23 , mean of 15 and a calculated mitral valve area of 0.9 cm. squared .
Her echo score was 10 .
There was more involvement of the lateral commissure and mild mitral regurgitation .
She also had mild aortic insufficiency , moderate tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 74 .
There was evidence of left-to-right shunting consistent with a patent foramen ovale prior to the trans-septal procedure .
She is now referred for PMV .
Synthroid , Vitamin E , Centrum , Potassium supplement , Lasix , Coumadin , Atenolol , and Ginkgo .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is a pleasant lady in no acute distress , blood pressure 130/70 , irregularly irregular pulses of 70 .
Jugular venous pressure normal and carotids normal .
Chest was clear .
Cardiac examination revealed an apical impulse at the fifth left intercostal space at mid clavicular line , right RV impulse was noted at the left sternal border .
First sound was increased but variable intensity , the second sound normally split with an increased P2 .
There was an opening snap followed by a long 2 out of 6 diastolic apical rumble .
There was no edema and there were good femoral pulses bilaterally .
SUMMARY :
The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where she was found to have a valve area of 0.6 cm. squared with a mean gradient of 20 .
She underwent successful PMV with a valve area increasing to 1.2 cm. squared and a gradient being reduced to 12 .
She did well overnight with no chest pain or shortness of breath .
She had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed prior to discharge , the results of which are pending at the time of this dictation .
The procedure was deemed to be successful and the patient was ultimately discharged on Coumadin , Plendil , Synthroid , Vitamin E , multivitamin , Ginkgo , Lasix , Potassium supplementation and Atenolol .
FOLLOW UP :
She will follow up with her primary care physician , Dr. <DOCTOR>Lupevickette Ca</DOCTOR> and her Cardiologist , Dr. <DOCTOR>Lenni Be</DOCTOR> .
