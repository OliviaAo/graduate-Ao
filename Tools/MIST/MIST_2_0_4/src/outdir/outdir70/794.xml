An initial CT scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in <DATE>August , 1996</DATE> showed a right wedge skull base mass .
A follow-up MRI showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke .
<DATE>November 19 , 1997</DATE> , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy .
Postoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received Gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a PEG was preformed .
He was discharged home with at follow-up MRI and on <DATE>December 25 , 1997</DATE> again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla .
Now preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing .
He is taking some liquids p.o. but also has G-tube feedings q.2h.

HOSPITAL COURSE :
This 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on <DATE>Jan 22 , 1997</DATE> a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .
He was extubated on postoperative day number one .
His neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .
He was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .
On postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .
A head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .
A culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .
A video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .
Because of continuing complaints by Mr. <PATIENT>Marker</PATIENT> about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .
Prior to admission Mr. <PATIENT>Marker</PATIENT> had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .
After conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. <PATIENT>Marker</PATIENT> did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .
His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .
His lumbar drain was removed after five days .
He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .
He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .
