PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
WORD DISABILITY AND PROBABLY DURATION :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PATIENT>Kotereef</PATIENT> is a <AGE>93-year-old</AGE> woman who was transferred from <HOSPITAL>Daleglo Medical Center</HOSPITAL> with renal insufficiency .
The patient was in her usual state of health until <DATE>7/10/98</DATE> when she was admitted to the <HOSPITAL>Daleglo Medical Center</HOSPITAL> with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes .
She was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days .
The patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
She has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .
In <DATE>01/95</DATE> she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness .
The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
On arrival to the <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her systolic blood pressure was 110 .
Her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
A chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .
A KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Goman 25</HOSPITAL> where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .
There was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient &apos;s diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .
The patient had been followed by Dr. <DOCTOR>Friednantflirt</DOCTOR> of the <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
She was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
Multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .
There was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .
The patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
Her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .
Her BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .
The patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .
Her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .
However , with the assistance of the patient &apos;s granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .
I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .
The patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .
I will get in touch with Dr. <DOCTOR>Areas</DOCTOR> and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .
