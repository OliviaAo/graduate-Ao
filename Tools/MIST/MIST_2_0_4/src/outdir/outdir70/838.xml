Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
<DATE>06/29/1991</DATE>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 81 year old woman with a history of hypertension , history of recurrent VPBs , admitted for investigation following a syncopal episode two weeks prior to admission .
The patient experienced a brief episode of loss of consciousness while driving her car two weeks prior to admission , at which time she collided with the car in front of her and rapidly regained consciousness .
There was no aura , no witnessed seizure activity and no post ictal symptoms .
The patient has a history of ventricular premature beats for which she was treated with Flecainide .
After the syncopal episode the patient was evaluated at a local hospital with head and abdominal CT , EEG , and EKG , all of which were normal .
Her Flecainide was discontinued and she was referred to <HOSPITAL>CTMC</HOSPITAL> for further evaluation .
Following discontinuation of this drug the patient noted return of palpitations .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Left mastectomy in 1982 for breast carcinoma .
History of upper GI bleeding in 1985 while on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines .
DJD , hypertension , status post cholecystectomy , status post cataract surgery , status post herniorrhaphy .
None known .
Vaseretic 10 mg p.o.q.d. , Calan SR 240 mg p.o.q.d. , Motrin 600 mg p.o. prn , Cytotec prn with Motrin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
Pleasant elderly lady in no apparent distress .
Blood pressure 140/70 , heart rate 84 , with occasional premature beats , respirations 16 , afebrile .
Showed bruises over both her knees .
HEENT :
Neck :
Supple without lympadenopathy .
No JVD .
Lungs :
COR :
Showed no JVD .
Normal S1 and S2 without murmurs .
Digital pulses were absent bilaterally .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , without masses .
CNS :
Alert and oriented .
Cranial nerves intact .
Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout .
Extremities :
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit 44 , WBC count 4.9 thousand , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 thousand , potassium 3.6 , PT and PTT were within normal limits .
LFTs were normal .
Cholesterol 252 .
Chest x-ray normal .
UA was normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a history of syncope for cardiac evaluation .
She was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where a catheterization revealed an 80% mid-RCA stenosis , 80% mid-LAD lesion and an LVEF of approximately 80% .
It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient &apos;s episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress .
On the following day , she was taken to electrophysiologic study .
During the study , the right bundle branch was hit by the catheter , inducing a right bundle branch block .
Following this , upon rapid atrial pacing at a rate of 120 , there was revealed a bifascicular left block , which combined with the right bundle branch block caused a complete heart block .
It was felt that given this rate-related block on the left , combined with the possibility of physiologic malfunction on the right , complete heart block as the source of the patient &apos;s syncopal episode was quite possible and plans were made to insert a VVI pacer .
The pacer was inserted on the fifth hospital day without event , and the patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day .
Calan SR 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Vaseretic 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ibuprofen and Cytotec prn joint pain .
The patient is discharged home .
Discharge condition good .

Report Status :
ADMISSION DATE :
<DATE>05-01-94</DATE>
DISCHARGE DATE :
<DATE>05-22-94</DATE>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Obstructive jaundice .
3. biliary obstruction .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy , <DATE>05/05/94</DATE> .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of <DATE>12/93</DATE> , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
On <DATE>01/24</DATE> she was taken to the <HOSPITAL>Rys Memorial Hospital</HOSPITAL> hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> and admitted there from <DATE>01/25</DATE> - <DATE>02/03</DATE> .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above ; appendectomy in 1916 , hysterectomy in 1941 , mastoid surgery in 1970 , shingles of right arm in 1994 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin daily .
She has no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with her children in <LOCATION>Co Darburg</LOCATION> and is quite active .
She is originally from <LOCATION>Tbalt</LOCATION> .

KUB :
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
On <DATE>05/05</DATE> an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
The General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on <DATE>05/08</DATE> a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
The patient &apos;s subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
