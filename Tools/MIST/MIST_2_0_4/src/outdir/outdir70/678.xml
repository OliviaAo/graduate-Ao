HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PATIENT>Larsen</PATIENT> was a 50-year-old salesman who in <DATE>12/26</DATE> was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .
He was found to have CML .
He was admitted on <DATE>06/07/00</DATE> for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On <DATE>06/24/00</DATE> the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On <DATE>06/26/00</DATE> due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
Although the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on <DATE>07/01/00</DATE> and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .
