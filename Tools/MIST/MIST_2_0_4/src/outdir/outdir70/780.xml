Report Status :

DISCHARGE DATE :
<DATE>9-21-94</DATE>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
3. acute renal insufficiency .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
A heterotopic kidney transplant , placed in the left pelvic fossa and native left nephrectomy on <DATE>8-29-94</DATE> .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
1. colonoscopy on <DATE>9-5-94</DATE> ,
4. renal biopsy on <DATE>9-13-94</DATE> .
He started on dialysis in <DATE>03/92</DATE> and has been maintained on it since .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post left arteriovenous fistula creation .
1. hypertension ,
2. difficulty hearing ,
4. history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , two prior episodes .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was negative .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was unremarkable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
During this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .
The patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .
He was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
The patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated .
A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction .
Again , he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .
He did have some postoperative hypertension which was controlled with Cardura and sublingual nifedipine prn .
Prednisone 20 mg PO q.day , Imuran 25 mg PO q.day , Acyclovir 200 mg PO t.i.d. , Bactrim one single strength PO qhs , Maalox 15 cc PO b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Verapamil 80 mg PO t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg PO b.i.d. , Cardura 4 mg PO b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 300 mg PO b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg PO q.day , Clotrimazole 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Inderal 10 mg PO t.i.d.
