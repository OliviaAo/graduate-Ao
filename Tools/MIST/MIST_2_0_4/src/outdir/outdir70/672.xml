PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Intracerebral hemorrhage .
Status post resection of a cerebellar medulloblastoma .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 50 year old , right handed , white male with a history of resection of left cerebellar medulloblastoma , resected six years ago and status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy , with a six month history of 30 pound weight loss , who was admitted to the <HOSPITAL>Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</HOSPITAL> with a left basilar ganglion hemorrhage .
At baseline , he had lived with his guardians , <PATIENT>Pandeprob</PATIENT> , he was &quot; slow &quot; , walked with a very ataxic gait , did not talk much and spends most of his time watching TV and smoking .
He had had several months of increased difficulty swallowing and slurred speech .
He had been evaluated by his local medical doctor for his weight loss .
He was transferred to the <HOSPITAL>Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</HOSPITAL> after being found in the bathroom , on the floor at 8 a.m. , unresponsive .
Cerebellar brain carcinoma , status post surgery , chemotherapy and radiation therapy six to seven years ago .
He had not had any recurrence .
He had history of alcohol abuse in the past .
There was no cardiac disease , hypertension or diabetes mellitus .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His oropharynx was clear .
His skin was clear .
The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 , regular rate and rhythm , no murmur , rub or gallop .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly .
Pulses were 2+ throughout .
The rectal tone was normal with no enlarged prostate , and he was heme positive .
Neurologically , he opened his eyes with sternal rub , but not verbalization .
He did not have verbal communication and he did not follow verbal commands .
His pupils were asymmetric , 6 mm. to 4 mm. on the left , right pupil was 5 mm. reacting to 3 mm.
There was no retinopathy .
He had a gag and good palpate movement .
He lifted his left leg off the bed , but no against resistance .
His deep tendon reflexes were noted for symmetric reflexes with upper extremities being 2 and patella 3 .
He had clonus bilaterally with up going toe on the right , but not the left .
LABORATORY DATA :
There was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .
On admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was a large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .
Once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .
An magnetic resonance imaging study on <DATE>07/17/92</DATE> showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest I minus on <DATE>7/27/92</DATE> did not show the mass initially noted .
A testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for mass .
There was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .
An abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non-enhancing .
The GI Service was consulted on this mass and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .
Initially , the patient remained drowsy until Decadron was added to his medical regimen .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the right side and ability to walk with assistance .
He was started on Dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .
This seemed to help him remarkably with increased activity .
He still spends a lot of time in bed , although easily arousable .
He needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .
Speech was nonfluent with occasional single words .
He followed all commands readily .
There was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .
He had limited vertical up gaze .
He still had a significant right central facial droop .
His gag was intact with palatal movements .
Thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .
He had approximately 4+ to 5/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities .
His left side was full .
He had marked dysmetria bilaterally , but left greater than right to finger to nose and his gait was very ataxic .
His deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the right with 3 right brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and patella .
He had right clonus , which was sustained .
A head computerized tomography scan was repeated on <DATE>08/08/92</DATE> which revealed some resolution of blood .
At that time , there was no evidence of a mass behind the hematoma .
It was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .
Thus , he should return to the <HOSPITAL>Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</HOSPITAL> to have a repeat head computerized tomography scan in one month to further evaluate a possible mass lesion behind the hematoma .
