Her hematocrit was 22.9 and platelets were l24 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
There was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur .
Plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .
The Radiation Service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .
Planning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the Radiation Service .
She was also seen by the Dermatology Service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis .
She was given Synalar Cream and Eucerin Cream as a moisturizer .
Due to Dr. <DOCTOR>Friednantflirt</DOCTOR> &apos;s concern that the tumor was growing despite the available chemotherapeutic regimen , the <HOSPITAL>Im Villtro University Medical Center</HOSPITAL> Medical Oncology Service was consulted .
However , they felt that at the <HOSPITAL>Venbonlea Health</HOSPITAL> , there were several possible options including a possible phase I trial regimen .
On the evening of <DATE>12/26/06</DATE> , the patient was discharged home in stable condition .
