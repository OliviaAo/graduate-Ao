Of note , the patient has had melena times months with multiple blood transfusions at the <HOSPITAL>Usoak Rinix Hospital</HOSPITAL> .
The patient , after having his melanotic stool , had a question seizure-like activity with question loss of consciousness .
EMS was called and found the patient &apos;s fingerstick blood sugar to be 24 .

Of note , the patient had a previously scheduled EGD for <DATE>03/17</DATE> .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
Ischemia :
The patient is status post a non ST elevation MI , a troponin peaked at 22 likely secondary to dehydration and presentation of acute renal failure .
The patient was managed on a beta blocker .
Pump :
Of note , the patient was transfused for a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells during this admission .
Repeat echo revealed an EF of 45-50% with inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis .
Overall , the patient had preserved LV function despite a large troponin leak .
2. GI :
A GI consult was obtained and the patient had adequate IV access .
The patient was started on Protonix IV 40 b.i.d.
Per GI consult given the patient &apos;s non ST elevation MI he would be a high risk candidate for a GI endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non ST elevation MI period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective GI workup in 4-6 weeks .
The patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but no evidence of bright red blood per rectum or large amounts of melena .
On the date of discharge the patient has stools that are only trace guaiac positive .
On admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
The patient &apos;s fingersticks were in the 150s without any coverage .
The patient was restarted on a low dose glipizide at 2.5 mg and adjustments to be made at the next PCP visit .
Hematocrit is stable .
Has remained stable above 30 without any need for further transfusions .
Over the last several days the patient received a total of 4 units packed red blood cells during this admission .
On discharge his hematocrit is 35.4 .
However , his urine cultures were positive for MRSA and the patient completed a seven day course of Vancomycin IV .
We have a low threshold for starting antibiotics ; however , chest x-ray reveals no acute changes and the patient remained 96% on room air throughout this admission without any stigmata over recurrent pneumonia including cough , dyspnea or shortness of breath .
