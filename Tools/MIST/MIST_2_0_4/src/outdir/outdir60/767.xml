HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on <DATE>11/25/94</DATE> .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on <DATE>11/28/94</DATE> and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on <DATE>12/3/94</DATE> .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .
