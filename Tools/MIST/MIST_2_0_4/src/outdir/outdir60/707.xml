DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Primary repair of atrioseptal defect , patent foramen ovale .
Ms. <PATIENT>List</PATIENT> is a 67 year-old diabetic woman with a known thoracic aortic dissection .
On <DATE>December 29 , 1996</DATE> , the patient developed abdominal and back pain and presented to <HOSPITAL>Drain Hospital</HOSPITAL> .
A dissected descending thoracic aorta was diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiogram .
She was intubated with pulmonary edema and followed by serial examinations .
The patient refused surgery per report .
<DATE>January 23 , 1996</DATE> , the patient had a CT scan , again showing ascending aorta with low density abnormality , with findings suspicious for involvement of the ascending aorta by dissection , bilateral pleural effusions were improved .
The patient denies history of myocardial infarction or chest pain .
She does have shortness of breath and pedal edema .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She does orthopnea of three to four pillows .
The patient underwent CT scan on <DATE>Jul 24 , 1997</DATE> , which demonstrated dissection of the ascending and archaorta to the root .
CT scan also demonstrated stable descending thoracic dissection with resolution of luminal compression .
As above .
Congestive heart failure .
Atrial fibrillation .
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
History of gastrointestinal bleed on aspirin .
Status post appendectomy .
Status post umbilical hernia repair .
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
Status postventral hernia repair .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
History of 40 pack years smoking , quit in <DATE>December , 1996</DATE> .
Occasional ethanol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is afebrile with irregular heart rate at 96 .
Oropharynx showed poor dentition with apparent decay of the remaining teeth and gum recession .
Neck showed 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits , increased jugular venous distention .
Cardiovascular was irregularly irregular rhythm and rate .
Holosystolic murmur , II / VI , at the left lower sternal border .
The abdomen was obese , protuberant , nontender with well-healed surgical scars .
Extremities showed no clubbing or cyanosis .
Significant for white blood cell count of 6.8. BUN 14 , creatinine 1 .
Liver function tests were within normal limits .
Urinalysis was negative .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 102 with an old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was evaluated by the Dental Service , who felt that it was necessary to extract several teeth and to follow several more , specifically tooth 15 and 16 , that were fully impacted .
The patient underwent echocardiogram on <DATE>Jul 25 , 1997</DATE> , demonstrating 2/4+ tricuspid regurgitation with a peak velocity of 2.9 ; mitral regurgitation 2/4 , mild concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle ; no systolic function with mild septal hypokinesis .
The aortic valve appeared sclerotic with mild to moderate insufficiency .
Dissection flap was noted .
The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization on <DATE>Jul 25 , 1997</DATE> , demonstrating elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 19 , right ventricular pressure of 56/19 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/39 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24/26/21 .
Non selective coronary arteriography performed did not reveal the presence of any focal coronary artery disease .
The aortic root angiography revealed the presence of an extensive ascending aortic dissection .
True lumen could not be accessed from either the left or right femoral artery .
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on <DATE>Jul 26 , 1997</DATE> , where she underwent resection and repair of chronic aortic dissection and reconstruction of the super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 as well as primary repair of an atrioseptal defect which appeared consistent with a patent foramen ovale and was 1-2 centimeters insize .
The patient required diuresis in her course after receiving multiple blood products .
Beta blocker was started as well .
The patient was transferred to the floor after a slow ventilator wean .
She will require continued therapy .
Otherwise the patient was neurologically intact .
She has worked well with Physical Therapy with regard to ambulation and has tolerated a regular diet without difficulty .
The patient was in persistent atrial fibrillation postoperatively .
The determination was made not to Coumadinize the patient given herchronic descending thoracic dissection and history of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient has been chronically in atrial fibrillation preoperatively without Coumadin therapy .
The patient did require extensive pulmonary toilet and she continues to benefit from nebulizer therapy , chest physiotherapy and diuresis .
DISPOSITION :
The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation for reconditioning in general and specifically in regard to her right upper extremity .

Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 milligrams q.4h. alternating with Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 milligrams inhaler q.4h. ; digoxin 0.25 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Lasix 60 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. times ten days , continuation or discontinuation of this medication per Cardiology ; K-Dur 40 mEqp .o. q.d. times ten days ; Glyburide 2.5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; sliding scale regular insulin q.a.c and h.s. ; Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain ; Lopressor 75 milligrams p.o.b.i.d.; Premarin 0.625 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Colace 100 milligramsp .o. t.i.d. ; Captopril 37.5 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. ; enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.
