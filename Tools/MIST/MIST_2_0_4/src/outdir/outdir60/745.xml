DISCHARGE DATE :
<DATE>12/03/96</DATE>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<DATE>8/21/96</DATE> , incision and drainage of right thigh .
<DATE>9/3/96</DATE> , transverse colostomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The wound became progressively indurated with drainage , and he presented for evaluation and treatment .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Prednisone .
Procardia .
Minipress .
Imuran .
Lasix .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an obese man in no acute distress .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and obese .
The genitourinary examination was notable for a suprapubic tube in place with normal male genitalia and guaiac negative stools on rectal examination .
Extremity examination revealed bilateral below-knee amputations with a 2 x 4 centimeter area of inflammation in the right popliteal fossa with a draining sinus .
Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
At the time of admission , BUN and creatinine were 89 and 4.4 ; white blood count 19.3 ; hematocrit 21.9 ; PT 15.1 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
There appeared to be a component of necrotizing fasciitis to this , and he was taken back to the operating room the next day for incision and drainage of a pelvic abscess and intraabdominal abscess .
His clinical condition continued to worsen with evidence of ongoing sepsis and renal failure , which transiently improved on hemodialysis , but generally progressively worsened .
On <DATE>9/3/96</DATE> , he underwent a transverse colostomy to allow diversion from the nonhealing leg and pelvis wounds .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
His nutrition remained poor throughout this time in spite of numerous attempts at enteral alimentation .
He was intubated at this time and could not be extubated thereafter .
He became increasingly more unresponsive and remained quite septic and febrile , resistant to aggressive antibiotic treatment .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
Over the next two days , Mr. <PATIENT>Elms</PATIENT> was kept comfortable and given intravenous fluids and tube feeds , but he remained extremely ill .
He continued to deteriorate until <DATE>12/3/96</DATE> , at which time he became bradycardic and asystolic .
He had no spontaneous cardiac or neurologic activity at this time , and he was declared dead at 12:15 A.M. on <DATE>12/3/96</DATE> .
