ALLERGIES :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 5 year old male with multiple anomalies transferred from <HOSPITAL>Capa An- Medical Center</HOSPITAL> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> on <DATE>07/20</DATE> for management of airway obstruction secondary to tracheal stenosis / history of difficult intubations .
The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and intubations .
On <DATE>08/10/90</DATE> the patient had surgery to remove granulomas in the trachea after traumatic intubation for seizures .
The patient first presented with stridor and respiratory distress on <DATE>02/92</DATE> .
A bronchoscopy at that time showed a 50% tracheal stenosis .
Since then the patient has had intermittent episodes of stridor with agitation with upper respiratory tract infections .
On <DATE>07/19/92</DATE> the patient awoke with significant stridor , respiratory distress and the use of accessory muscles .
The patient was taken to the emergency room where he was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy .
On <DATE>07/19/92</DATE> direct laryngoscopy showed an 80% tracheal stenosis beginning just below the sternal notch involving the proximal 50th percent of the trachea .
The patient was a difficult intubation and it was finally performed by a thoracic surgeon using a 3.5 endotracheal tube .
The patient was then hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at <HOSPITAL>Asney Ewood Health Care</HOSPITAL> in <LOCATION>Losbroke Pringda Field Delp U</LOCATION> and maintained with Pavulon and Morphine .
The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health immediately prior to this hospitalization with no history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms , fever , cough , vomiting , diarrhea or decreased appetite .
1. Respiratory :
The patient remained intubated and maintained on a Pavulon and Morphine drip through until <DATE>7/21/92</DATE> .
The patient was noted to have a stenosis of the proximal trachea approximately 3 cm long just below the vocal cords .
The patient was also noted to have mild right mainstem bronchus stenosis too .
Very mild .
The patient had a 3-0 Shiley trach placed approximately 1 cm below the vocal cords .
The trach extends approximately 1 cm below the area of stenosis .
I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative .
There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia that could have precipitated this event and all X-Rays have been unremarkable .
The patient has a history of significant hyperinflation of the chest with an increased AP diameter which is mildly improved after the tracheostomy .
The patient received oxygen for approximately 24 hours after the tracheostomy and is presently being maintained on room air with a humidified mask .
Cardiac :
The patient had some evidence of doubled T waves on the day of arrival .
These T waves have since cleared and the patient is otherwise unremarkable .
Please note that the last arterial blood gases was Ph 7.40 , PCO2 of 41 , PO2 of 112 , bicarbonate of 25 .
Fluids and Nutrition :
The patient was initially NPO and then begun on Pediasure feeds the first two days of hospitalization .
The patient has presently been weaned over to his regular diet which is generally some crackers , cereal and occasional bits of food .
GI :
This was felt to be mild aspiration .
The patient also had episodes of frequent coughing .
KUB on <DATE>7/23</DATE> showed hugely dilated loops of colon and small bowel which only briefly respond to an enema .
The patient last received enema on <DATE>7/24</DATE> in the p.m.
HEM :
The patient has generally been stable .
His initial hematocrit was 31% .
His hematocrit on transfer was 33% .
The patient never received blood during the procedure .
Renal :
The patient has always had good urine output with normal BUN and creatinine .
Neurological :
The patient has a history of of seizure disorder .
He has been stable here .
Levels on arrival showed a Phenobarbital level of 25 , Tegretrol level of 3.1 .
The patient has had problems taking p.o. Tegretol during this hospitalization and levels need to be checked in the near future .
Infectious Disease :
The patient arrived receiving ceftriaxone for one day down in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> .
The child only had a one time spike on pod 1 to 103 .
Three trach aspirates have all been unremarkable .
The blood cultures are unremarkable , sputum cultures are unremarkable , urinalysis was also negative .
The trach appears to be quite stable and the patient is tolerating having his trach in quite nicely with a humidified mask .
The plans per ENT are that the patient &apos;s trach will not be changed for at least one months time .
Dr. <DOCTOR>Fields</DOCTOR> will contact Dr. <DOCTOR>Roosekote</DOCTOR> as to probable plans .
It appears that Dr. <DOCTOR>Fields</DOCTOR> wants to re-evaluate the child in 4 to 6 weeks with another bronchoscopy and feels that possibly tracheal reconstruction may be possible at that time .
The parents are being transferred back to <LOCATION>Newstonpend</LOCATION> to learn trach care and to set up homecare .
If you have any questions please contact me .
There is always someone here .
Additional laboratory data of note is a last white blood count on <DATE>7/24</DATE> was 9,000 with a differential of 70 polys , 25% lymphs , hemoglobin 10.1 , platelet count 351,000 .
Electrolytes were normal on <DATE>7/23/92</DATE> and the last gas was as stated above .
