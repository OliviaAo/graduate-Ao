MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION .
DIABETES ADULT ONSET .
HISTORY OF CARDIOVASUCLAR ACCIDENT .
GUAIAC POSITIVE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
He has no history of hypertension or family history .
In 1960 , the patient had an MI complicated by ventricular ectopic arrhythmia .
Since then , he has had rare angina over the past year , and has been able to walk his dog one mile a day with occasional mild left-sided chest pain that is always relived by a brief rest .
He also notes an induration caudication in his left calf .
On <DATE>12/15/90</DATE> , he had a parietal headache at 8:00 a.m. that was followed promptly by left-sided chest pain without diaphoresis , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , or palpitations which lasted for an hour with awaxing and waning course .
He went to the <HOSPITAL>Tlowepeh Hospital</HOSPITAL> Emergency Room , where his blood pressure was 120/80 , heart rate was 94 , respiratory rate was 32 , and he had a blood gas which was pO2 73 , pH 7.44 , pCO2 32 , and a chest x-ray that showed mild congestive heart failure .
His EKG showed an intraventricular conduction delay with anterolateral ST depressions and T waves inversions .
Chest pains were relieved with oxygen by nasal prong , two liters .
He was tansferred to the Coronary Care Unit where he was treated with IV nitroglycerin and Diltiazem .
Quinidine level on <DATE>12/16</DATE> was 1.4 .
He had mild CHF , which was treated with Captopril and prn Lasix .
He had recurrent chest pains noted on both <DATE>12/17</DATE> three times , <DATE>12/19</DATE> one time , and <DATE>12/21</DATE> .
The episode on <DATE>12/21</DATE> was noteworthy for shortness of breath and ST depression in V4-6 which required IV TNG , which was used briefly that night .
On <DATE>12/22</DATE> , he was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Norri Hospital</HOSPITAL> for evaluation of his post MI angina .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
B12 IM , iron sulfate 324 mg t.i.d. , Diltiazem 60 q.i.d. , Diabeta 5 mg p.o.q.d. , Quinaglute 324 mg q. 12 hours , one baby aspirin b.i.d. , Halcion 0.25 mg p.o.q.h.s. , Nitrol Paste , Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d. , Slow-K two tablets p.o.q.d. , Captopril 0.25 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Zantac 115 mg p.o.b.i.d , and Carafate 1 gram p.o.b.i.d.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease complicated by myocardial infarction and ventricular ectopic arrhythmia in 1960 , also a left-sided CVA in 1960 , adult onset diabetes , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation of unknown duration , anemia which was consistent with iron deficiency , a left retinal hemorrhage status post laser treatment last year .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature of 97 degrees with a rate of 90 in atrial fibrillation and blood pressure 110/82 .
Heart examination showed a PMI , which was diffuse and inferiorly displaced with an auricular rhythm with an S1 and S2 , II/VI systolic ejection murmur , no rub or gallop was noted .
Pulses :
2+ femoral without bruit , 1+ dorsalis pedis on the left , trace dorsalis pedis on the right and trace posterior tibial bilaterally .
Hemoglobin was 10.7 white cell count was 8.2 , platelets 211 , PT and PTT were 13.4/37.6 , Quinidine was 2.5 , and CKA was 53 .
Repeat ABG done later had a pH of 7.38 p02 of 247 , O2 saturation of 99.9% , pC02 22 , total C02 of 14 .
The patient was admitted to the unit and experienced some nausea and vomiting with minimal EKG changes .
He became tachycardic to the rate of 110 , with a blood pressure of 128 to 130 .
His heart rate went down to 60 .
At this time , he was also given 25 mg po of Lopressor .
He complained of continued nausea and vomiting .
He was given Compazine PR and was started on Dopamine and then Dobutamine was added when that did not appear sufficient to increase his blood pressure above 80 .
He had a good urinary output .
His systolic blood pressure was then in the 100 to 110 range and at that time his IV fluids were decreased .
However , acutely at around 8:00 p.m. the systolic blood pressure plummeted down to 60 to 70 and at this time a chest x-ray was done which showed moderate CHF .
On the above chest x-ray no evidence of dissection was noted .
Even with the increase in the pressors , heart rate dropped into the 50s .
Oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .
The patient was intubated and prior to intubation his rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .
He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .
Atropine one amp was given .
There was a question of fleeting T waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead EKG .
At this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .
At this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .
The rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.
The patient was without respirations or blood pressure .
The family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .
