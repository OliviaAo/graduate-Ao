4. Dementia .
5. Gallstone pancreatitis .
6. Fungal cystitis .
7. Intra-abdominal infection .
8. Total parenteral nutrition dependent .
<DATE>4/28/95</DATE> .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. <PATIENT>Mass</PATIENT> was a 56 year old white male who was transferred from <HOSPITAL>Vassdiysey Medical Center</HOSPITAL> for rule out pancreatic pseudocyst .
Mr. <PATIENT>Mass</PATIENT> had a past medical history which included Wegener &apos;s granulomatosis , history of an anterior myocardial infarction , and gallstone pancreatitis .
He was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Vassdiysey Medical Center</HOSPITAL> with severe recurrent pancreatitis , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain .
His amylase on admission there was 1,961 .
The patient had two recent admissions for pancreatitis in <DATE>January 1994</DATE> , and <DATE>August 1994</DATE> .
His amylase decreased to 51 , and the increased back to 151 on hospital day #10 .
At that time , he spiked a temperature to 103 .
He also became increasingly confused .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. As above .
Ejection fraction was felt to be 35% in 1993 .
Recent echocardiogram suggests ejection fraction of 15% .
3. Wegener &apos;s granulomatosis , with associated chronic renal insufficiency .
2. Pepcid , 20 mg. , intravenously , q12h.
3. Digoxin , 0.125 mg. , intravenously , qD .
4. Imipenem , 500 mg. , intravenously , q6h.
6. Vasotec .
7. Alterajel .
10. Demerol , prn .
Ativan .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Temperature was 102 , heart rate was 110 , respiratory rate was 22 , blood pressure was 113/63 .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat was benign .
Lungs :
Rales at the right base , bilateral decreased breath sounds at the bases .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count was 14.4 , hematocrit was 36.2 , platelet count was 217 , sodium was 135 , potassium was 3.3 , chloride was 99 , bicarbonate was 25 , BUN was 40 , creatinine was 1.9 , glucose was 124 , urinalysis was negative , PT was 12.2 , PTT was 24.5 , calcium was 7.8 , phosphorus was 3.7 , albumin was 2.3 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , alkaline phosphatase was 202 , SGPT was 32 , SGOT was 64 , LDH was 998 , amylase was 150 .
Evidence of old left anterior septal infarct .
Chest X-ray :
Large left ventricle , bilateral atelectasis or effusion .
IN SUMMARY , the patient was considered to have severe necrotizing pancreatitis , with severe cardiac disease .
The patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
On <DATE>4/17/95</DATE> , GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
On <DATE>4/28/95</DATE> , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
Because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on <DATE>4/28/95</DATE> .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .
Thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
Mr. <PATIENT>Mass</PATIENT> was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on <DATE>07/15/95</DATE> .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
Mr. <PATIENT>Mass</PATIENT> was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
3. Isordil , 10 mg. , po , t.i.d.
4. Nitropaste , 1 inch to chest wall , q8h.
5. Carafate , one gram , po or per nasogastric tube , q.i.d. , Cardizem , 30 mg. , po , q6h , digoxin , 0.25 mg. , po or intravenously , qD , fluconazole , 200 mg. , qD , for five more days , after transfer , for a total of a 14 day course , total parenteral nutrition to meet the patient &apos;s nutritional needs .
The patient has an ostomy appliance around the former site of his pancreatic fistula drain .
This area has continued to drain and it is felt that it could be best managed by an ostomy appliance and stoma care .

IMPRESSION :
Electrocardiogram changes and prior history of coronary artery disease made her management necessarily cautious .
She made progress , despite her overall medical status .
She was dialyzed for - 2 L .
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Her Vancomycin level was checked and was 9.8 .
On heparin , her PTT was monitored .
She refused blood draws and was somewhat difficult to manage in the absence of any end points and any ability to monitor her bloods .
