DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .
3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PATIENT>Breutzfarstxei</PATIENT> is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
He was seen by Dr. <DOCTOR>Seen</DOCTOR> and Dr. <DOCTOR>Seen</DOCTOR> as an out-patient .
On <DATE>02/06/91</DATE> , he was seen in <HOSPITAL>FLFDMC</HOSPITAL> and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .
He was evaluated in the Emergency Room .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .
Cultures were taken and he was sent out .
On <DATE>02/08/91</DATE> , the patient called Dr. <DOCTOR>Seen</DOCTOR> because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .
3) Status post right elbow surgery .
4) Venereal disease history .
5) PPD anergic .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Revealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .
He had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .
Had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .
CARDIAC :
Showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
ABDOMEN :
His spleen was not palpable .
RECTAL :
He had guaiac positive stools .
Unremarkable .
His penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .
Non-focal .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .
PT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .
Sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .
( On <DATE>02/06</DATE> , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .
His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
However , on <DATE>02/10/91</DATE> , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on <DATE>02/10/91</DATE> .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On <DATE>02/13/91</DATE> , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on <DATE>02/16/91</DATE> and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on <DATE>02/15/91</DATE> .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of <DATE>02/18/91</DATE> .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.
An autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .
