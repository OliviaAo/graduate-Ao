It has not been sudden or acute .
She occasionally feels chest twinges which are nonradiating but are sharp .
They last a few seconds on the left side and are not associated with sweating , nausea , vomiting or syncope .

ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
PHYSICAL EXAM :
In the emergency room , vitals were temperature 96.4 , pulse 40-50 , blood pressure 154-58 , satting 86% on room air , 99% on 3 liters of 3 liters cannula .
Rate 28 .
2 plus carotids .
Oropharynx is clear without lymphadenopathyin the neck .
Jugular venous distention to the jaw .
LUNGS :
Crackles 1/3 up bilaterally .
CARDIAC :
Regular , rate and rhythm .
Normal S1 and S2 .
No rubs or gallops .
EXTREMITIES :
3 plus pitting edema to the knee bilaterally with areas of darkened erythema which is crusted , indented .
A shallow chronic ulcer in the right shin with desquamation bilaterally around the ankle and half way up the shin .
1 x 2 cm ulcer with clean sharp borders to the dermatome on the left posterior thigh .
NEUROLOGICAL :

Calcium 8.8 , white blood cell count 10.6 , hematocrit 37.1 , platelets 289 .
Small left effusion .
No pneumonia .
Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm at 50 .
Normal axis .
primary AV block .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Cardiovascular :
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;
An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .
Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .
She has episodes of not breathing .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Discharge INR 1.8 .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :
Low salt diet .
Low cholesterol , low fat diet .
To rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
House diet .
Low saturated fat .
Low cholesterol .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
Need to try to control blood pressure .
Can increase her Ace inhibitor as tolerated .
May start beta-blocker at a low dose given mild bradycardia at atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day .
Need to continue oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula .
Needs anticoagulation for 6 months for right common femoral artery deep venous thrombosis .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
Should continue Keflex for 10 more days or as clinically indicated .
Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. x 10 more days , Miconazole 2% powder topically b.i.d. apply to affected areas of breasts and groins b.i.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q day hold of systolic blood pressure less than 110 , Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously q 12 hours x 2 doses and then discontinued , atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q day hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 110 , heart rate less than 55 .
