ADMISSION DATE :
DISCHARGE DATE :
She was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Aper Hospital</HOSPITAL> for change in mental status on <DATE>7/19/2002</DATE> .
Initial work up was unrevealing .
She was diagnosis with a urinary tract infection and perineal inflammation and was transferred to the hospital and treated with IV Tequin for urinary tract infection .
Throughout her admission , she experienced occasional low-grade temperatures to 99 Fahrenheit with persistent leukocytosis .
There was a reported examination of her peritoneal fluid when fluid was being drawn for culture .
A catheter was subsequently placed for treatment of __________ for three days of ceftazidime .
She was switched , however , to hemodialysis from peritoneal dialysis .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for end-stage renal disease secondary to chronic urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis with vesicoureteral reflux .
And status post right nephrectomy , status post cholecystectomy , ____________thyroidectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE <HOSPITAL>BRI HEALTH</HOSPITAL> FROM <HOSPITAL>APER HOSPITAL</HOSPITAL> :
Aspirin 81 mg qd , Epogen 10,000 units tiw , folate 4 mg qd , K-Dur 20 mEq , magnesium oxide 400 mg po qd , Phenergan 12.5 mg q4h prn , Prinivil 5 mg qd , Renagel 20 mg po qd , vitamin E 400 IU bid , pamidronate 30 mg IV q3months .
Include SULFA , CODEINE , TETRACYCLINE , NITROFURANTOIN .
Not available at the time .
She denies the use of tobacco or ethanol .
She was raised in the <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> and spent many years on an organic farm .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
The patient was afebrile at 98.7 , blood pressure 128/64 , heart rate 96 , respiratory rate 22 , 02 s 96% on room air .
The pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation .
The oropharynx was moist .
The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm .
There was no palpable lymphadenopathy .
The heart had a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no hepatosplenomegaly .
There was no erythema around the catheter site .
On neurologic examination , the patient followed only simple commands .
She missed her nose with both hands when asked to touch her nose .
There was a questionable positive Babinski on the right side .
The toes were downgoing on the left .
She answered appropriately to yes-no questions , but _____________
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 .
Her liver function tests were all within normal limits .
Her coagulation factors showed a PT of 13.2 , INR 1.2 , PTT 23.2 .
Her white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 .
The hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 .
The differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes .
The electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .
Head CT scan on <DATE>07/30/2002</DATE> showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe .
The patient &apos;s presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer &apos;s of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .
Work up included from a neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .
In concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .
For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .
For prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .
However , these antibodies were both within normal limits .
The patient &apos;s mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from <DATE>08/10</DATE> through <DATE>08/12</DATE> and was markedly improved on <DATE>08/13/2002</DATE> , compared with the day of admission .
However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .
The nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .
On the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .
We entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .
We will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .
Pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the <HOSPITAL>Termarimed</HOSPITAL> pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .
