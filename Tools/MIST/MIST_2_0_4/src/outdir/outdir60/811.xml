DIS
Admission Date :
<DATE>02/20/1994</DATE>
Discharge Date :
<DATE>03/13/1994</DATE>
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :
2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
4. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
6. CERVICAL POLYPS
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
She was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .
Patient also received AICD .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
Patient &apos;s past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
Since that time the patient has been treated medically .
Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .
Coronaries were completely normal .
In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .
Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .
Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .
Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
Furthermore , due to the patient &apos;s long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .
The patient did well at home until <DATE>1/31/94</DATE> when she was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Souland</HOSPITAL> in <LOCATION>Nixmont Bovo</LOCATION> with increasing congestive heart failure .
At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .
By report , in the interim since discharge from <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .
She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> for further evaluation .
The patient was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> on <DATE>02/20/94</DATE> , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the <HOSPITAL>Alllo Eino Hospital</HOSPITAL> which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient &apos;s arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient &apos;s hospitalization without difficulty .
On <DATE>02/22/94</DATE> an EPS study was performed .
The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .
Consequently AICD placement was recommended .
Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .
Thus , AICD placement was performed on <DATE>03/09/94</DATE> following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
By <DATE>03/10/94</DATE> the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .
It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to <LOCATION>Vonamemp , LA</LOCATION> via plane by herself .
This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Type II diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps .
NKDA .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Positive tobacco history although the patient quit approximately 1 year ago .
History of alcohol formerly 6 pack per day long-standing , however , the patient currently does not use alcohol .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Positive for lung cancer and positive for hypertension .
Within normal limits .
NECK :
Supple with 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally , negative for bruits .
Jugular venous pressure approximately 8 cm , negative for lymphadenopathy .
CARDIOVASCULAR :
Regular rate and rhythm , II / VI systolic murmur , negative for L3 .
LUNGS :
Clear to auscultation bilaterally with an inspiratory squeak at the left lower base .
ABDOMEN :
Negative for clubbing , cyanosis or edema , and 2+ pulses throughout .
Nonfocal .
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 93 , bicarb 34 , BUN 14 , creatinine .8 , glucose 155 , hematocrit 51.3 , platelet count 255 , white count 8.1 .
As mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation .
As per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <DATE>03/09/94</DATE> .
Hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to AICD placement .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is discharged to home in stable condition on <DATE>03/13/94</DATE> .
At the time of discharge , the patient was on Coumadin 2 mg q.h.s. , K-Dur 20 mEq po q.d. , magnesium oxide 420 mg po q.d. , Isordil 10 mg po t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg po q.d. , Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. , Digoxin .25 mg po q.d. , Captopril 25 mg po t.i.d. , Beclovent inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. , Proventil inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. , Tylenol #3 1 tablet 30 mg po q. 2-3 hours times 1 day prn pain or discomfort .
