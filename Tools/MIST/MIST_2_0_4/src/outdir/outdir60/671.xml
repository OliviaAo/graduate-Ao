Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
congestive heart failure .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
He had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .
Despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .
Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .
The venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .
There was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .
The liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .
His chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .
The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to <DATE>June , 1992</DATE> .
Later , an echocardiogram on <DATE>3/27/93</DATE> , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .
The aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .
The left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .
There was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .
A Persantine Thallium scan on <DATE>3/31/93</DATE> , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .
potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .
This was of uncertain significance .
The hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .
Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .
Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on <DATE>4/1/93</DATE> .
There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .
Left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .
There was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .
The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .
A dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .
A large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .
The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
The saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .
These findings were reviewed with Dr. <DOCTOR>Patella</DOCTOR> and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. <PATIENT>Breun</PATIENT> &apos;s management .
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .
He is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .
We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. <DOCTOR>Wierst</DOCTOR> and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .
