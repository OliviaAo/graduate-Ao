Hepatitis B-related cirrhosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Tuberculosis in childhood .
(3) Grade I esophageal varices .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Repeated pleurocentesis .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
He was admitted to the Medical Service where he was found to have a transudative , right-sided effusion thought again to be the equivalent of his ascites on the basis of end-stage liver disease .
It was tapped and drained with placement of a chest tube .
The chest tube was removed , but then replaced on the <DATE>14th of February</DATE> , and maintained a continuous and large volume output .
This change in mental status remained refractory to medical management , and in the setting of recurrent spiking fevers and worsening renal function , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on the <DATE>17th of February , 1997</DATE> .
In the Intensive Care Unit , his chest tube continued to have massive volume output , and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid .
Early in his Intensive Care Unit admission , Mr. <PATIENT>Hibbslires</PATIENT> was intubated and ventilated , placed on broad antibiotic coverage including Vancomycin , Fluconazole , Ceftazidime , and Flagyl .
His renal function continued to worsen and he developed hypervolemic hyponatremia , and hemodynamic parameters consistent with sepsis .
Blood cultures in this setting grew out Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic coverage was altered to cover this organism appropriately .
During the first week of <DATE>February</DATE> in spite of antibiosis , the patient developed worsening renal failure , became anuric , and developed rapid progression in spite of his chest tube of the right-sided hydrothorax in addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome vs. extreme volume overload .
He became dependent on pressers .
In consultation with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <DOCTOR>Leynslentnerswaimjesc</DOCTOR> and with his gastrointestinal physician , Dr. <DOCTOR>Loydbreunlinke</DOCTOR> , and with the patient &apos;s family , the decision was made in the setting of his grim prognosis and multiple morbidities that further aggressive treatment would not be pursued .
The patient was evaluated for continuous venous venous hemodialysis , which in the end in the setting of the family &apos;s wishes , was not begun with this patient .
On the <DATE>27th of February</DATE> , the patient succumbed to overwhelming sepsis and anuric renal failure , and hypervolemia .
The time of death was 5:16 A.M. on the <DATE>27th of February , 1997</DATE> .
Dr. <DOCTOR>Leynslentnerswaimjesc , Lau</DOCTOR> , and <DOCTOR>Launtburce</DOCTOR> were notified .
