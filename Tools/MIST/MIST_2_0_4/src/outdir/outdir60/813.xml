HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .
Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on <DATE>November 20</DATE> , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .
Pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .
Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on <DATE>November 20</DATE> of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .
Idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .
However , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .
A single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on <DATE>November 20</DATE> indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .
On <DATE>November 30</DATE> , a family meeting with patient &apos;s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. <DOCTOR>Tomedankell Bile</DOCTOR> , attending physician , Dr. <DOCTOR>Mellerny Close</DOCTOR> , and house staff , was held to discuss patient &apos;s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
Decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient &apos;s comfort .
Such measures have been continued through <DATE>December 3</DATE> , and patient remains comfortable through this time .
