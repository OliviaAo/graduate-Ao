The heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained PMI which was located in the left mid clavicular line , S1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .
It radiates to both carotids bilaterally .
