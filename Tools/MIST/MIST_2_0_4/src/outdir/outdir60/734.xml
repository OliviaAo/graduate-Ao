HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a long history of alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease as well as seizure disorder related to alcohol withdrawal and multiple <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> admissions for detox and multiple detox facilities in the past .
The patient also recently ( <DATE>06/93</DATE> ) was diagnosed with infiltrating cancer of the hypopharynx and was scheduled to undergo XRT but had not yet started .
Recently the patient noticed hoarseness secondary to vocal cord involvement of the tumor .
On the day of admission the patient was in a detox center undergoing detox prior to beginning his XRT and was in his usual state of health at that time when he had the acute onset of coughing after swallowing some chicken a la king .
The patient also was noted to have secretions draining from his mouth .
He was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Stamgibonnole Hospital</HOSPITAL> for further evaluation .
Despite multiple attempts at extraction at that point they were unable to extract the foreign body and it was felt that the patient should be admitted and attempt extraction later in the afternoon .
1) Alcohol abuse complicated by hepatitis , cirrhosis , seizure disorder , encephalopathy .
3) Hypertension .
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , shellfish , Doxycycline , also the patient had rash with Ceclor .
MEDICATIONS :
On transfer included Dilantin 100 mg po t.i.d. , Ceclor , Motrin , Percocet p.r.n.
Neck exam no JVD or lymphadenopathy .
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Extremities with trace pedal edema , 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses .
Dilantin level 13.7 .
SMA 7 was unremarkable aside from a glucose of 173 and a potassium of 3.1 .
UA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .
Extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .
EGD was performed .
Subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .
There was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .
The patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately <DATE>9/22/93</DATE> when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .
The patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .
Other GI issues include the patient &apos;s hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .
2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .
Because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .
3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .
A swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .
Several NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .
The patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .
The family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient &apos;s nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .
It is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .
The patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on <DATE>9/22/93</DATE> at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .
The chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .
No organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .
It was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .
He had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .
7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .
It was decided the patient &apos;s code status would not be DNR , DNI .
8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .
He underwent extraction of all his teeth on <DATE>9/21/93</DATE> tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a GI bleed .
Laboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .
The white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .
The last PT and PTT on <DATE>09/26/93</DATE> were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on <DATE>09/27/93</DATE> showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .
A faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .
Extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on <DATE>9/21/93</DATE> .
COMPLICATIONS :
1) Aspiration pneumonia .
2) GI bleed .
3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .
