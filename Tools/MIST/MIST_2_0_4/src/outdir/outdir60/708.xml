HOSPITAL COURSE and OUTCOME :
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service and commenced amiodarone loading .
Adenosine stress MIBI revealed a small reversible defect in the PDA territory and the patient underwent coronary catheterisation on <DATE>1/6/0004</DATE> which revealed a 70% lesion in the SVG to PDA -&gt; cypher stented successfully .
During his admission , his am fasting glucose levels were intermittently elevated and his HbA1C was greater than 7 .
On the day prior to discharge he noticed a small area of erythema surrounding his R antecubital venous access site .
This will be treated empirically with a 10 day course of Keflex .
I have instructed him to see his PCP if it does not improve in a few days or if he develops fevers .
In terms of his amiodarone , he will be discharged on 400mg po bid for a further 7 days followed by 400mg qd thereafter .
He will followup with Dr. <DOCTOR>Levels</DOCTOR> in device clinic in 4 weeks .
I have advised him that he must not drive until he is seena gain in clinic and his device interrogated .

LABORATORY DATA :
sodium 135 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 101 , C02 28.4 , BUN 17 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 302 , calcium 8.6 , phosphorus 2.5 , magnesium 1.6 , total protein 6.7 , albumin 3.3 , globulin 3.4 , uric acid 6.3 , totalbilirubin .7 , alkaline phosphatase 93 , SGOT 20 , LDH 258 , CPK 95 , whiteblood count 15.3 , hematocrit 49.7 , platelet count 159 , MCV 98 .
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES :
Chest x-ray <DATE>10/10/97</DATE> :
The patient also had a shoulder film done on <DATE>10/10/97</DATE> that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .
A lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on <DATE>10/10/97</DATE> , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
Two major fracture fragments were seen at the humeral head , articulating with the glenoid fossa .
Innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal humeral shaft .
The glenoid fossa was intact .
normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , Q - waves seen in II , III , and AVF with probable old inferior myocardial infarction .
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on <DATE>10/17/97</DATE> .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on <DATE>10/12/97</DATE> , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on <DATE>Columbus Day</DATE> which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on <DATE>10/19/97</DATE> , and all muscular in origin .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on <DATE>10/15/97</DATE> , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. <DOCTOR>Fordwoodall Stick</DOCTOR> , in <LOCATION>Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156</LOCATION> .
The patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in <LOCATION>Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848</LOCATION> through his primary-care physician .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at <HOSPITAL>Bri Health</HOSPITAL> , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( <DATE>10/23/97</DATE> ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on <DATE>10/22/97</DATE> was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on <DATE>10/18/97</DATE> to 25/1.9 on <DATE>10/18/97</DATE> to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on <DATE>10/23/97</DATE> .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units on <DATE>10/15/97</DATE> for a hematocrit of 27.6 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on <DATE>10/18/97</DATE> for a hematocrit of 29.4 .
Repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .
The patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .
Stable , good .
