The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
This prompted further staging work-up .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .

Calcium 11.8 .
Hematocrit was 30.6 .
PTT was 29.8 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
A bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .
Ahead CT scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the right vertex of the calvarium but no intracranial abnormalities .
Work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .
The abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed no suspicious GI masses , no pancreatic mass ; a 2 cm ovarian cyst .
The review of the pathology from <HOSPITAL>Bri Health</HOSPITAL> confirmed a high grade adenocarcinoma .
The CA-125 was still pending and alphafeto protein is still pending .
Hypercalcemia :
The patient presented with a serum calcium of 11.8 and an albumin of 2.3 on admission .
She received three days of intravenous etidronate with normal saline diuresis and the serum calcium subsequently decreased to 9.0 .
IVC obstruction :
The patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by CT scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic IVC .
This has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .
The patient &apos;s low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .
Hypoxia and shortness of breath :
The patient had back pain on admission without any focal neurological signs .
The MRI scan on admission revealed an impending cord compression at the level of T10 .
