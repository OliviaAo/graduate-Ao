On admission included diltiazem CD , 240 mg po q day ; Isordil , 5 mg po t.i.d. ; aspirin , one po q.o.d. ; Dyazide , one po q.o.d. ; allopurinol , 300 mg po q day ; Levoxine , 0.1 mg q day ; Leukorin , 2 mg two po q a.m.
ALLERGIES :
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Negative except for increasing fatigue in the past two weeks and leg cramps at night .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a blood pressure of 158/88 .
Temperature 97.4 .
Physical examination was significant for ulcerated fungating lesions on his left ear , dorsum of his hands .
There was a right carotid bruit .
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2 , S4 without murmurs .
Spleen was felt 4 cm below the costal margin .
Pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally .
Neurological exam was nonfocal .
On admission included a white blood cell count of 77.8 with 82% lymphs .
Hematocrit 35.2 .
Platelet count 104,000 .
Potassium 4.4 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , normal axis and intervals , no changes from previous EKG , no signs of ischemia or infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization on <DATE>11/2/92</DATE> which showed the following :
Pressures RA 9/4 , RV 24/7 , PA 24/12 with a mean of 14 , PCW 12/9 with a mean of 10 .
Cardiac output 6.7 .
Cardiac index 3.2 .
There was also 50% occlusion of the left proximal circumflex , 95% occlusion of the right proximal coronary artery , 50% occlusion of the OMB1 , 90% occlusion of the mid LAD .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The patient then underwent PTCA of the distal RCA lesion .
Because of difficulty passing the wire through the graft to the RCA , the proximal 95% RCA lesion was dilated first and then the distal RCA lesion was dilated .
The patient did not experience any chest pain during the procedure and has not had any chest pain since the procedure .
The sheaths were removed on <DATE>11/4/92</DATE> and heparin was restarted four hours after sheath removal and maintained for two days because of a possible small dissection in the RCA .
Repeat hematocrit showed it to be stable at 27 on <DATE>11/5</DATE> .
It was thought that the drop in hematocrit was secondary to his chemotherapy , some small dilutional effect and small blood loss from the PTCA , although there was no evidence of significant bleeding .
The patient was asymptomatic except for some back pain from lying flat after the catheterization procedures .
His vital signs remained stable .
