Documented .
Diarrhea responded initially to Paromomicin , but subsequent medical compliance was poor .
4. Cerebral toxoplasmosis , stable , on suppressive therapy .
Titer stable at 1:8 on suppressive therapy .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was treated with PPN and elemental diet , for correction of metabolic disturbances , improved fluid balance , and nutritional support .
Paromomycin was continued until his supply was used up , and charithromycin was continued .
His diarrhea diminished .
However , KUB showed persistent change , consistent with ileus or early partial small bowel obstruction .
On this admission and on previous outpatient laboratory data , potassium and phosphorus tended to be very low so Neutra-Phos K was continued at discharge .
Lomotil was held at discharge because of question of ileus , but may be reinstituted at a very low dose , for example , 1-2 per day .
2. Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma :
He was treated with Vincristine , followed several days later by Bleomycin , with return of his condition to somewhat better than baseline on admission .
It was planned to give him one more dose of Vincristine prior to discharge .
There was a decrease in CBC , which was ascribed to AZT , which was discontinued .
