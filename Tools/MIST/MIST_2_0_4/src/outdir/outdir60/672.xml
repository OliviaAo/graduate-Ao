PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
At baseline , he had lived with his guardians , <PATIENT>Pandeprob</PATIENT> , he was &quot; slow &quot; , walked with a very ataxic gait , did not talk much and spends most of his time watching TV and smoking .
A recent head computerized tomography scan in <DATE>01/92</DATE> was negative .
He had been evaluated by his local medical doctor for his weight loss .
He was transferred to the <HOSPITAL>Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</HOSPITAL> after being found in the bathroom , on the floor at 8 a.m. , unresponsive .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
He had not had any recurrence .
He had history of alcohol abuse in the past .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
A generally cachectic white male , resting quietly with his eyes closed .
His blood pressure was 140/70 , heart rate 75 .
His oropharynx was clear .
His skin was clear .
The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 , regular rate and rhythm , no murmur , rub or gallop .
Extremities - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The discs were flat .
There was no retinopathy .
He had a gag and good palpate movement .
There was a right facial droop which was mild .
He lifted his left leg off the bed , but no against resistance .
He had clonus bilaterally with up going toe on the right , but not the left .
LABORATORY DATA :
An erythrocyte sedimentation rate 3 , hematocrit 44 , white blood count 21.7 , lytes within normal limits .
The head computerized tomography scan without contrast showed a 3 x 3 x 5 cm. hemorrhage extending form the left Sylvian fissure and put amen to the left front oparietal lobe .
There was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was a large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .
His blood pressure was not elevated .
The aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and B12 .
An magnetic resonance imaging study on <DATE>07/17/92</DATE> showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .
The medial region of the hematoma was felt to be suspicious for tumor versus arteriovenous malformation .
There was no enhancement seen in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .
A cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for mass effect from the hematoma .
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and G-tube was performed at the same time .
There was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .
This confirmed an 8 mm. mass which was bright on T2 and homogeneous in the right lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with a benign hemangioma or cyst .
The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .
Initially , the patient remained drowsy until Decadron was added to his medical regimen .
He awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the right side and ability to walk with assistance .
He was started on Dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .
This seemed to help him remarkably with increased activity .
His Decadron has been tapered slowly to zero and his examination on discharge was as follows :
He still spends a lot of time in bed , although easily arousable .
He sleeps with a hypophonia , but occasionally will speak louder when he is in better spirits .
His pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .
There was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .
He had limited vertical up gaze .
He still had a significant right central facial droop .
His gag was intact with palatal movements .
On repetitive testing with Speech Therapy had not been able to swallow in a safe manner .
Thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .
He had approximately 4+ to 5/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities .
HE had an upgoing toe .
On the left , his reflexes wee 2-2+ with a downgoing toe .
He had right clonus , which was sustained .
At that time , there was no evidence of a mass behind the hematoma .
It was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .
Depending upon his head computerized tomography scan , he will proceed to a brain biopsy if needed .
