HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service under the care of Dr. <DOCTOR>Lenni Pain</DOCTOR> .
Her abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .
A KUB performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .
This was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .
She was admitted and made NPO .
On admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 .
She was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
Her ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .
She was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .
She continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs .
However , repeated abdominal x-rays and CT scans continued to show no signs of obstruction or perforation .
However , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .
By <DATE>7/15/96</DATE> she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .
By <DATE>7/18/96</DATE> she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued .
She was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on TPN .
She was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .
