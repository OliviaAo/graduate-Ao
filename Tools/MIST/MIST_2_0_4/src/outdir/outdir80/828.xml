<DATE>05-22-94</DATE>
DISCHARGE DATE :
Adenocarcinoma of the lung .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Aortic stenosis .
3. insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
5. atrial flutter .
6. gastrointestinal bleeding .
7. cerebrovascular accident .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
Right therapeutic thoracentesis , <DATE>06/07/94</DATE> .
Brain MRI , <DATE>06/12/94</DATE> .
Placement of chest tube for bleomycin sclerotherapy , <DATE>06/20/94</DATE> .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
She had a long history of significant and complex medical issues .
She had a long history of smoking and fairly severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
In addition , she had insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a recent myocardial infarction in the <DATE>November of 1994</DATE> .
On <DATE>02/20</DATE> she was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Secla Berl Spo Hospital</HOSPITAL> with a chief complaint of chest discomfort and dyspnea .
She eventually ruled in for a myocardial infarction and was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital</HOSPITAL> on <DATE>02/21</DATE> .
Following her hospitalization at <HOSPITAL>Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital</HOSPITAL> he was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Louline Mauikings Medical Center</HOSPITAL> , where she had a protracted hospitalization during which she was treated for congestive heart failure , gastrointestinal bleeding , and uncontrolled atrial flutter rates .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , she was an elderly female in moderate respiratory distress , blood pressure 100/60 , respirations 26 , pulse 68 , temperature afebrile .
Her jugular venous pressure was within normal limits .
Arterial pulse contours were diminished bilaterally .
S1 and S2 were markedly diminished .
A soft systolic ejection murmur was audible at the base .
A soft Grade I-II / VI holosystolic murmur was evident at the apex .
No S3 was present .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds present and no pulsatile masses evident .
The lower extremity pulses were diminished .
There was 2+ lower extremity edema evident .
No grossly evident focal neurological findings were noted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Crestwall Hospital</HOSPITAL> , where a therapeutic thoracentesis was performed in order to alleviate her dyspnea .
Cytology was positive for moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma .
A cardiac ultrasound study on <DATE>Memorial Day</DATE> demonstrated an aortic stenosis with a calculated valve area of .6 square cm .
Following an episode of mild rightsided weakness associated with slurring of speech on <DATE>06/06</DATE> , a brain MRI was obtained .
An enhancing focus in the left thalamus was thought to represent a subacute infarct .
Dr. <DOCTOR>Margmimaui Jesclinke</DOCTOR> was consulted and helped significantly with the day to day management of the patient &apos;s COPD and frequent desaturations in the setting of a large , recurrent right pleural effusion .
During the course of the last 4-5 days the patient &apos;s condition deteriorated substantially .
After extensive consultation with her family and with the patient herself , it was decided that her status should be made DNR .
This was completely consonant with her wishes and her family &apos;s wishes as well .
Over the weekend of <DATE>06/30</DATE> and <DATE>07/01</DATE> , her condition further deteriorated , and she was started on a morphine drip .
We insured that she was comfortable until she expired on <DATE>07/02/94</DATE> .
