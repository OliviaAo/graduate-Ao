Chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia , no congestive heart failure .
Electrocardiogram revealed Q-waves in leads II , III and AVF .
A computerized tomography scan revealed right lower occipital low-density area .
The right suggested decreased flow .
Carotid noninvasives revealed minimal carotid disease .
Transcranial Dopplers :
normal posterior and anterior circulation .
Holter electrocardiogram :
no significant arrhythmias .
Electroencephalogram :
normal study .
Visual field testing :
Echocardiogram revealing segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving inferoseptal , inferior and posterior segments at the base and mid ventricular level .
Otherwise , there was pulmonary insufficiency , tricuspid insufficiency , mitral insufficiency and aortic insufficiency .
There were no clots seen on the echocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was started on intravenous heparin and had the studies as described above for rule out source of embolic strokes including carotid noninvasives , transcranial Dopplers , Holter electrocardiogram and echocardiogram .
The patient also had serial electrocardiogram , which showed no change .
The patient also had serial creatinine kinase with MB fractions studied , which revealed MB fraction too low to be tested .
This moving sense , with normal electroencephalogram , was thought to be a mild vestibular dysfunction or from the acute episode of the stroke .
The patient will have these symptoms only when the eyes are closed .
Our opinion was not to intervene or have any further studies for acute period and to continued to observe .
