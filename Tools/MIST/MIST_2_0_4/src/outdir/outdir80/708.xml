BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
78 M w/ longstanding CAD s / p CABG &apos;97 , had PPM and AICD placed in &apos;02 after admitted for presyncope and found to have inducible VT .
in USOH until this am when felt LH and then ICD discharge .
Subsequent 4 ICD discharges at rest .
Denies change in ET , chest pain , SOB .
Went to OSH c further ICD shocks , VT on monitor but stable VS .
Given amio bolu , started on gtt and transferred to <HOSPITAL>NVH</HOSPITAL> for further evaluation .
Exam remarkable for b / l carotid bruits , soft murmur at L sternal border , clear chest , 1+ b / l edema .
Labs at OSH c Cr :
1.9 ,
39.1 ,
gluc :
214 ,
CK :
130 ,
MB :
2.6.
ECG is AV paced but prior shower R on T VPB c monomorphic VT then overdrive paced .
**** Course
1) CV ( R ) finished amio IV load then started on po , agressive lytes ; although interrogation showed &gt;100 episodes of VT ( as / x ) , pt prefers med therapy as opposed to ablation ( I ) enzymes mildly elevated but not actively ischemic ; lipids , ASA , statin , BB ; Adenosine thal <DATE>1/4</DATE> and echo <DATE>1/4</DATE> to look for signs of ischemia as active cause for VT ( P ) JVP at angle of jaw <DATE>1/4</DATE> --&gt; giving 20 Lasix ; dig level <DATE>1/4</DATE> 1.3 --&gt; 1/2 dose as on Amio
2) Endo :
elevated glu on admit BMP and FSG also concurring --&gt; follow and Lispro ; will probably need w / u as outpt
baseline PFTs as staring amio
4) GI :
baseline LFTs wnl ; taking cardiac / ADA diet as glu remains elevated
5) Renal :
baseline CRI ( 1.2-1.6 ) with elevation at admission probably prerenal ; will monitor BUN / Cr after giving Lasix
6) Proph :
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service and commenced amiodarone loading .
Adenosine stress MIBI revealed a small reversible defect in the PDA territory and the patient underwent coronary catheterisation on <DATE>1/6/0004</DATE> which revealed a 70% lesion in the SVG to PDA -&gt; cypher stented successfully .
He had occasional ventricular extopyon telemetry but no further recurrence of ventricular tachycardia .
During his admission , his am fasting glucose levels were intermittently elevated and his HbA1C was greater than 7 .
I have explained to him that he may have developed some glucose intolerance and that , in the first instance , he should see his Primary Care Physician and attempt dietary control .
On the day prior to discharge he noticed a small area of erythema surrounding his R antecubital venous access site .
This will be treated empirically with a 10 day course of Keflex .
In terms of his amiodarone , he will be discharged on 400mg po bid for a further 7 days followed by 400mg qd thereafter .
He will followup with Dr. <DOCTOR>Levels</DOCTOR> in device clinic in 4 weeks .
