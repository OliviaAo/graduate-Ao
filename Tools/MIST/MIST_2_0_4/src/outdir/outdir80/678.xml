<DATE>07/02/2000</DATE>

OTHER DIAGNOSES :

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PATIENT>Larsen</PATIENT> was a 50-year-old salesman who in <DATE>12/26</DATE> was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .
He was admitted on <DATE>06/07/00</DATE> for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
White blood cell count of 24.409 and platelets of 956,000 .
The patient received his bone marrow transplant on <DATE>06/12/00</DATE> .
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On <DATE>06/24/00</DATE> the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Although the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on <DATE>07/01/00</DATE> and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .
The patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on <DATE>07/02/00</DATE> .
