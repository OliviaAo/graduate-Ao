DISCHARGE DATE :
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
1) Obstructive jaundice , secondary to recurrent tumor and / or stricture at the bile duct to jejunum anastomosis .
2) Subhepatic fluid collection , drained .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES :
On <DATE>3/28/95</DATE> , replacement of permanent biliary stents and liver biopsy .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
On <DATE>3/24/95</DATE> , percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram .
On <DATE>3/27/95</DATE> , <DATE>3/28/95</DATE> , <DATE>3/30/95</DATE> , <DATE>3/31/95</DATE> , and <DATE>04/04/95</DATE> there were revisions and contrast injections to the biliary catheter drainage system .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 55-year-old man who is status post resection of a Klatskin tumor , who returns with persistent jaundice and right upper quadrant pain .
The present illness is marked by presentation with jaundice and pain in <DATE>August of 1994</DATE> , and a computerized tomography scan that showed bile duct dilatation .
In <DATE>October 1994</DATE> , the Klatskin tumor was resected and it was shown to be moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma .
The surgical margins were positive and he was treated postoperatively with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
He was admitted in <DATE>January 1994</DATE> , for biliary drainage catheter placement and balloon dilatation of what was thought to be an anastomotic stricture .
Since that time he had been persistently jaundiced and fatigued , until three weeks prior to admission when the patient had a biliary tube check , which showed things to be patent despite his rising bilirubin .
He presented now for evaluation of failed biliary drainage .
On physical examination , he had a normal temperature and blood pressure .
His lungs were clear .
His head and neck showed marked scleral icterus and a cardiac examination showed a systolic ejection murmur .
The abdomen was soft and had well healed right upper quadrant scar .
The extremities were unremarkable .
Rectal examination was negative and his neurological examination was intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics and studied with an abdominal computerized tomography scan .
The computerized tomography scan showed dilated left and right hepatic ducts and was consistent with some form of blockage of the drainage arrangement .
The procedures took place on several days throughout the hospital stay with the sentinel pro cedure taking place on <DATE>3/28/95</DATE> , and this was placement of the 10 mm diameter metal wallstents .
Subsequent to that , he was found to have a subhepatic fluid collection , which was suspicious for a bile leak and therefore a drain was placed percutaneously into this collection .
His bilirubin by the time of discharge had fallen from a peak of 28 down to a discharge value of 8 .
During the course of the hospitalization , he was found to have diarrhea and stool was sent and found to be positive for Clostridium difficile toxin and this initiated treatment with Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for two weeks .
He was covered prophylactically for the indwelling stents with ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d.
On <DATE>04/04/95</DATE> , it was deemed he was ready for discharge and Dr. <DOCTOR>Blinjesc</DOCTOR> discharged him to the care of his primary physician , Dr. <DOCTOR>Ma</DOCTOR> , in <LOCATION>Taette</LOCATION> .
