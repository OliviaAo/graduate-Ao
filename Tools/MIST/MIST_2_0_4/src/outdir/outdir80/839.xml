DISCHARGE DATE :
<DATE>05-22-94</DATE>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gastric outlet obstruction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Obstructive jaundice .
2. metastatic adenocarcinoma to the liver .
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy , <DATE>05/05/94</DATE> .
Gastrojejunostomy , <DATE>05/08/94</DATE> .
The patient is a <AGE>111y</AGE> year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on <DATE>05/01</DATE> complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .

An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The stones were then removed .
She was discharged home .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .

KUB :
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
On <DATE>05/05</DATE> an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
The General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on <DATE>05/08</DATE> a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
The patient &apos;s subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
