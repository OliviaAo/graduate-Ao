The neck was supple without adenopathy .
The chest examination was remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally , with regular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and obese .
The genitourinary examination was notable for a suprapubic tube in place with normal male genitalia and guaiac negative stools on rectal examination .

His clinical condition continued to worsen with evidence of ongoing sepsis and renal failure , which transiently improved on hemodialysis , but generally progressively worsened .
