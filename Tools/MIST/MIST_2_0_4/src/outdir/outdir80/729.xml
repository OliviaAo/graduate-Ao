The patient is a 52 year old right hand dominant white female who presented with recurrent tumor in the left CP angle and middle fossa .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is unremarkable until 1977 when she developed left eye and face pain , accompanied by numbness .
A computerized tomography scan was felt to be normal .
In 1989 , she started developing incoordination in her left upper extremity .
A magnetic resonance imaging study at that time revealed a left CPA tumor with pontine compression .
This tumor was partially resected in <DATE>08/89</DATE> with nondiagnostic pathology , finally labeled as a hamartoma .
She was followed with serial imaging studies .
She also noticed loss of balance .
There was no change compared with a previous study of <DATE>12/92</DATE> .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Wound was clean .
No tetanus shot had been received .
FAMILY HISTORY :
The family history is negative for brain tumor or neurologic disease .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is a retired airline worker , 35 pack year smoking history , no alcohol use .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Tegretol 200 mg PO t.i.d. , Medrol taper begun on the <DATE>9th</DATE> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , 4 to 2 millimeters , direct and consensually .
Fields were full , extra ocular movements were full with bilateral end gaze nystagmus .
Sensory to the face was markedly diminished to pin prick , light touch and temperature over V1 and V2 and to a lesser degree V3 .
There was a minimal corneal reflex and no response to nasal tickle on the left .
Motor to the face was intact .
Vision was intact bilaterally .
Jaw was strong .
Head was turned well to the right , decreased somewhat to the left and gag was present bilaterally .
Strength was full on the right side and 5-/5 in the left trapezius , deltoid , ECR , triceps , ankle flexion , ankle extension and extensor hallucis longus , and 4+ iliopsoas .
The deep tendon reflexes revealed 3+ in the lower extremities , 2+ in the upper extremities , upgoing toe on the left and a question of an upgoing toe versus withdrawal on the right .
There was no ocular dysmetria or speech dysarthria .
Her regular gait was unsteady and tandem gait was quite unstable .
The rapid alternating movements , fine finger movements , finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were all decreased on the left .
In addition , there was question of some upgaze nystagmus and diminished upgaze in the left eye , perhaps to 90%. .
LABORATORY DATA :
Admission labs were unremarkable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On <DATE>11/8/93</DATE> a left frontal temporal craniectomy was done and an extensive subtotal removal was done .
Complete resection of the tumor was not possible due to its involvement with the brain stem .
The patient tolerated the procedure well , however developed a more complete fifth cranial nerve palsy in the V1 to V2 distributions , a new sixth nerve palsy , and postoperatively had a transient seventh nerve palsy which was almost completely resolved at the time of discharge .
She was discharged to rehabilitation for an approximately two week stay .
She is using an eye patch which greatly relieves her discomfort due to the diplopia .
She underwent a slow Solu-Medrol taper over two weeks .
She complained of persistent neck stiffness , likely secondary to a chemical meningitis .
Her wound remained clean and dry and she was discharged to rehabilitation after a computerized tomography scan without contrast was performed for postoperative assessment .
Tegretol 200 mg PO t.i.d. , Cimetidine 300 mg PO q6h while on steroids , and a Solu-Medrol taper as indicated .
She will return to Dr. <DOCTOR>Fossa</DOCTOR> &apos;s office .
