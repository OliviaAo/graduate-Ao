LABORATORY DATA :
Four liter arterial blood gas of 71/43/7.45 , ionized calcium 1.03 , normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine 16/1.4 , glucose 246 , calc , mag and phos normal , albumin 2.2 , LDH 227 , liver function tests normal , white count 10.6 , hematocrit 32 which was 31 on the 19th and 38 on the 16th , prothrombin time 9.9 , partial thromboplastin time 26 .
Cultures of the blood , urine and sputum were pending at that time .
A sputum gram stain showed moderate polys with few gram negative rods .
A chest X-ray showed bilateral opacities in the bases with increased interstitial markings .
These improved with decreased rate .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit and placed on Unasyn for a question of aspiration pneumonia .
He was also placed on intravenous nitroglycerin , oxygen and aspirin for his coronary ischemia .
No heparin was given because of his esophageal laceration .
No beta blocker was given because of his history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
The patient remained stable in the Coronary Care Unit and was transferred to the floor on the <DATE>23rd</DATE> on aspirin , Carafate , intravenous Haldol , nebs , Unasyn , NPH with CZI sliding coverage , morphine , Compazine and intravenous Benadryl .
His blood gas at that time on 40 percent face mask was 84 , 42 , 7.48 .
His hematocrit was 28 at the time of transfer .
He was still guaiac positive at that time .
The patient did well on the floor initially with improvement in his arterial blood gases and mental status .
The clot was dense despite multiple attempts at lavage .
There was no lesion noted in the stomach .
The pylorus was entered and the first and second portion of the duodenum were inspected and were seen to be normal .
The scope was retroflexed in the antrum where it showed a normal fundus of the stomach and normal esophagogastric junction .
It was felt the patient &apos;s GI bleeding was secondary to his previously known esophageal tear .
He was readmitted to the Coronary Care Unit on the <DATE>25th</DATE> , where initially he was stable .
His aspirin was discontinued .
He was continued on the intravenous Cimetidine and Carafate except that he was made NPO .
He was transfused to keep hematocrit greater than 30 .
He was seen in consultation by the <HOSPITAL>OLH</HOSPITAL> Service , who felt he was a candidate for total parenteral nutrition .
On the <DATE>25th</DATE> he developed progressive hypotension with evidence of further upper gastrointestinal bleeding .

On the <DATE>26th</DATE> , because of continued massive bleeding , he was taken by Vascular Radiology for a question of embolization .
Three sites of active extravasation were found , one from the gastroesophageal junction area and two from the gastric fundus .
All sites were successfully embolized with Gelfoam with non-selective arterial embolization of the spleen occurring as well .
He was continued to be managed with packed red blood cells , platelets and fresh frozen plasma .
He was continued to be intubated with poor mental status .
He was paralyzed for the vascular procedure .
A head computerized tomography scan on the <DATE>26th</DATE> showed a probable right cerebellar infarct and a question of a right middle cerebral artery infarct .
