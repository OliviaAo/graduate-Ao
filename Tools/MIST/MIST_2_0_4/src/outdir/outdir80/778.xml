Heart rate 60 , respiratory rate 18 , blood pressure 116/80 , temperature 97.1 degrees , oxygen saturation 93% on room air .
Head and neck examination was benign .
Skin examination was notable for a leg ulcer and cellulitis to be delineated below .
There were no spider angiomata .
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained PMI which was located in the left mid clavicular line , S1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .
It radiates to both carotids bilaterally .
There was also a blowing holosystolic murmur heard at the patient &apos;s apex to axilla .
Vascular examination was notable for 1+ carotid impulses which were diminished and delayed and the above mentioned transmitted cardiac murmurs .
Neurological examination revealed that the patient was quite sedated at this time having received some medications .
Her pupils were reactive bilaterally .
Her face was symmetric .
She was able to move all four of her extremities in response to pain .
Her deep tendon reflexes were slightly diminished at 1+ bilaterally , but symmetric .
LABORATORY :
The patient &apos;s laboratory data on admission is as follows :
Sodium was 142 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 99 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 .

Urinalysis revealed trace microscopic hematuria with 47 red blood cells per high powered field , 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .
The Neurology Service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection , her multiple medications , or her metabolic condition .
The patient &apos;s mental status slowly began to recover , however on the morning of the first day of admission , <DATE>August 16 , 1998</DATE> , the patient was found after having fallen .
The patient decided not to pursue further testing with a neck CT scan .
At the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s mental status is back to its baseline .

Fortunately , these issues were not active during the present admission .
The patient did fall while inhouse .
A head CT scan and cervical spine series were negative .
