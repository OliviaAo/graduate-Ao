SUMMARY PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
DUODENAL PERFORATION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 60 year-old gentleman with a past medical history of gastric lymphoma status post total gastrectomy / splenectomy in 1991 with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction .
The patient noted onset of diffuse abdominal pain , periumbilical and epigastric in nature , nausea and vomiting and back pain starting at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission , <DATE>03/13/00</DATE> .
The patient denies fevers , chills or sweats , shortness of breath or chest pain .
He had a normal bowel movement the day prior to admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
History of small bowel obstruction in <DATE>04/17</DATE> and <DATE>07/15</DATE> , pancytopenia , history of right renal calculus .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Splenectomy , total gastrectomy as above , for gastric lymphoma for which he also received chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Epogen and Vitamin B 12 injections .
ALLERGIES :
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
White blood cell count 4.5 , hematocrit 31.9 , creatinine 1.1 .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 65 , blood pressure 101/74 , 100 percent oxygen saturation on room air .
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , nontender .
No hernias .
The patient did have right costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
There was no evidence of perforation on the CT scan .
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of <DATE>03/13/00</DATE> and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .
This was taken down and the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .
There was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .
However by the mid morning of the <DATE>14th of March</DATE> , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .
The patient was invasively lined with a Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .
At this point the patient &apos;s creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .
The Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .
On <DATE>03/14/00</DATE> the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .
Upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .
However prior to this it was also noted that the patient &apos;s scrotum was necrotic .
An incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .
Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .
The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .
Upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic-like picture and was maintained on Neo-Synephrine .
He was hydrated vigorously .
This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .
therefore the patient went back to the operating room on <DATE>03/15/00</DATE> for another exploratory laparotomy .
Further debridement was undertaken .
The patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .
The patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .
On <DATE>03/16/00</DATE> the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .
Unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .
The patient &apos;s family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of <DATE>03/16/00</DATE> .
The patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of <DATE>03/17/00</DATE> .
