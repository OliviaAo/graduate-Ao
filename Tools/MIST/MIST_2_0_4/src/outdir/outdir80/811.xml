CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest <DATE>02/04/94</DATE> .
Patient also received AICD .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
Patient &apos;s past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
In 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in <LOCATION>Hispit , Delaware</LOCATION> .
Since that time the patient has been treated medically .
In <DATE>07/93</DATE> the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .
On <DATE>09/93</DATE> the patient underwent transplant evaluation at <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .
Coronaries were completely normal .
Consequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .
In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .
Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .
Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .
Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
Furthermore , due to the patient &apos;s long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .
The patient did well at home until <DATE>1/31/94</DATE> when she was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Souland</HOSPITAL> in <LOCATION>Nixmont Bovo</LOCATION> with increasing congestive heart failure .
By report , in the interim since discharge from <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
Dring this hospitalization at <HOSPITAL>Hahkellrick Hospital</HOSPITAL> , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .
She was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .
She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> for further evaluation .
The patient was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> on <DATE>02/20/94</DATE> , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the <HOSPITAL>Alllo Eino Hospital</HOSPITAL> which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient &apos;s arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
On <DATE>02/22/94</DATE> an EPS study was performed .
Consequently AICD placement was recommended .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <DATE>03/09/94</DATE> .
Consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .
Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Thus , AICD placement was performed on <DATE>03/09/94</DATE> following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .
By <DATE>03/10/94</DATE> the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .
At this point it was felt the patient would go home on <DATE>03/13/94</DATE> .
It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to <LOCATION>Vonamemp , LA</LOCATION> via plane by herself .
This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Type II diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps .
ALLERGIES :
NKDA .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , digoxin .125 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg q.d. , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , dobutamine 2.3 mg per kilogram per hour , Xanax .25 mg prn , Beclovent 2 puffs q.i.d. , Proventil 2 puffs q.i.d. , K-Dur 20 mEq q.d. , magnesium oxide 400 mg t.i.d. and Colace 100 mg b.i.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE :
As mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation .
As per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <DATE>03/09/94</DATE> .
Hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to AICD placement .
Note , for the question of the right forearm thrombophlebitis , the right forearm was debrided and sent for culture and pathology .
Cultures were negative .
Debridement was negative for purulent discharge .
Pathology is only significant for inflammation , and not infection .
The patient did well following the AICD placement .
At the time of discharge , the patient was on Coumadin 2 mg q.h.s. , K-Dur 20 mEq po q.d. , magnesium oxide 420 mg po q.d. , Isordil 10 mg po t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg po q.d. , Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. , Digoxin .25 mg po q.d. , Captopril 25 mg po t.i.d. , Beclovent inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. , Proventil inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. , Tylenol #3 1 tablet 30 mg po q. 2-3 hours times 1 day prn pain or discomfort .
