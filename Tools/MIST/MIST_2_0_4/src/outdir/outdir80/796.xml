HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .
These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on <DATE>12/16/97</DATE> , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .
A pulmonary arteriogram on <DATE>01/03/98</DATE> demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of <DATE>12/19/97</DATE> .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on <DATE>01/08/98</DATE> , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. <PATIENT>Less</PATIENT> condition was irretrievable .
Dr. <DOCTOR>Cantsleddjesc</DOCTOR> felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on <DATE>1/16/98</DATE> .
