In <DATE>September 2004</DATE> , the patient converted to AML with Philadelphia chromosome 9:12 and received induction chemotherapy and recovered slowly with blasts .
In <DATE>November 2005</DATE> , a bone marrow biopsy showed 80% cellularity and 40% of the intratrabecular space was composed of AML cells .
Hydrea was started due to splenic pain .

Mr. <PATIENT>Lyfranklapalm Kote</PATIENT> is a 65-year-old man with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome that could vary to acute myelogenous leukemia who is status post a nonmyeloablative allogenic transplants via protocol of <ID>27-518</ID> , the GVAX study , who was readmitted for right upper lobe infiltrate .
The remainder of the dictation will be divided by system :
1. Oncology :
The patient is status post nonmyeloablative &quot; many allogenic bone marrow transplant on <DATE>12/12/04</DATE> .
Neutrophils have yet twin graft , GMCSF was stopped in a setting of increased splenic pain .
Throughout this admission , the patient has had a climbing level of blasts ( 44% on the day of discharge ) consistent with recurrent leukemic disease .
All immunosuppressants were discontinued except for tacrolimus .

CMV viral loads were all negative .

The patient does have thrush .
The patient had no active bleeding during this admission .
The patient was given red blood cells and platelets to maintain his hematocrit above 26 and his platelet count above 10,000 .
4. Cardiovascular :
The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout this admission .
He had one brief episode of chest pain that was spontaneously resolved .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes and no further workup was pursued .
5. Musculoskeletal :
The patient had a right middle finger pain , which developed during this admission without any preceding trauma .
This pain was felt to be due to arthritis .
Plain film x-rays revealed no bony injury .
6. Psych :
Celexa 20 mg daily was started this admission for treatment for depression .
1. Acute myelogenous leukemia .
2. Right upper lobe infiltrate , not otherwise specified , possibly infectious / fungus versus recurrence of leukemic disease .
