Gastric outlet obstruction .
1. Obstructive jaundice .
2. metastatic adenocarcinoma to the liver .
3. biliary obstruction .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy , <DATE>05/05/94</DATE> .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a <AGE>111y</AGE> year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on <DATE>05/01</DATE> complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of <DATE>12/93</DATE> , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> and admitted there from <DATE>01/25</DATE> - <DATE>02/03</DATE> .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The stones were then removed .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .
Approximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of 15 lb , and nausea and vomiting .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
She was admitted for workup of her symptoms .

PT 11.8 , PTT 23.9 .
KUB :
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
On <DATE>05/05</DATE> an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
