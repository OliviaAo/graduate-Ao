Discharge Date :
<DATE>05/19/1995</DATE>
CAUSE OF DEATH :
MULTISYSTEM ORGAN FAILURE .
SEPSIS .
TIME OF DEATH :
<DATE>5/19/95</DATE> at 3:15 a.m.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PATIENT>Stone</PATIENT> is a 59-year-old gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , alcoholic cirrhosis , and rectal cancer , who was scheduled for a resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the Medicine team for improvement of his heart failure .
He has a long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy , presumably due to alcohol .
He has mitral regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and an aortic valve area of 1.1 cm. squared with a peak gradient of 36 to 54 .
He has also had atrial fibrillation since 1990 , which has been rate controlled on Digoxin .
He was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon following an episode of bright red blood per rectum and 3.5-cm. sessile lesion at 27 cm. , which was biopsied through a colonoscopy , which revealed adenocarcinoma .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% .
Adenocarcinoma of the colon .
Cirrhosis .
Recurrent urinary tract infections .
Mitral valve regurgitation of 4+ .
Aortic stenosis .
Cellulitis and sepsis in 1992 .
Hyponatremia .
Peripheral vascular disease .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Lasix 40 mg. b.i.d. Tagamet 400 mg. b.i.d. Lisinopril 10 mg. q. day .
Digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfa medications .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His temperature was 99 .
Heart rate was 110 .
Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air .
He had jugular venous distention to the level of the jaw in the upright position .
His heart rate was irregularly with a 2/6 holosystolic murmur .
His chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one-halfway up the chest .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the Medicine Service and diuresed with Lasix and started on Captopril with the Lisinopril discontinued .
After many discussions between Dr. <DOCTOR>Leickgrend</DOCTOR> , the patient , and his family , concerning the severely high risk , given the patient &apos;s conditions , it was decided to proceed with the operation .
On <DATE>4/27/95</DATE> , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .
His fluids were very strongly restricted , and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the Operating Room with 400 cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated .
He was taken to the Post-Surgical Intensive Care Unit , intubated and stable .
He continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator .
He was finally extubated on <DATE>5/10/95</DATE> , and despite respiratory rates in the 30s and very coarse , rhonchorous breath sounds , the patient continued to have acceptable oxygen saturation and acceptable blood gases on minimal oxygen .
His status , however , remained volatile , and in keeping his volume status somewhat on the dry side to optimize his pulmonary status , he became relatively oliguric and hypernatremic .
He required some fluid boluses with D-5-W to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance .
On <DATE>5/14/95</DATE> , he returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for very aggressive pulmonary toilet .
On <DATE>5/15/95</DATE> , he was taken to the Angio Suite for an attempted transhepatic internal jugular porta caval shunt .
His portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm. , going from 26 to 23 , so no shunt was placed .
On <DATE>5/17</DATE> , he spiked a temperature to 103 with rigors and shaking chills .
His respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently .
At that time , multiple discussions were held with the family , and they decided to enact a Do Not Resuscitate order .
Mr. <PATIENT>Stone</PATIENT> &apos;s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine .
His urine output remained very low .
His white blood cell count rose to 22,000 with a 50% bandemia .
A Swan-Ganz catheter revealed an SVR of 350 , and he was started on Neo-Synephrine and Epinephrine prior to the Do Not Resuscitate order .
Throughout the day on <DATE>5/18/95</DATE> , his blood pressure continued to fall in the 80s , then 70s , then 60s , and at 3:15 a.m. on <DATE>5/19/95</DATE> , despite multiple pressors , his blood pressure dropped down to 50 ; he then went into ventricular fibrillation , followed by flat line .
At that time , he had no spontaneous respirations and no audible heart tones .
He had no carotid pulses , no gag reflex , and no pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .
He was pronounced dead at 3:15 a.m.
The family was contacted and were present at his bedside .
A postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family .
