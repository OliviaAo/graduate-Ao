BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient is an 80 year old female with a history of dementia , and of a choreoathetotic movement disorder of unclear etiology .
She has had these problems for approximately 10 years , and is cared for by a family member .
W / U for Huntington &apos;s , ceruloplasmin , TSH , etc have all been negative in the past .
Now presents with report of sub-acute worsening of confusion .
Patient was admitted to neurology service .
She had a gradual imporvement of her confusion back towards baseline during the hospital stay .
The major therapeutic change during the hospitalization was the starting of zyprexa to see if as part of its side-effect profile it would decrease the choreoathetotic movement symptoms .
Infact , this medication was found to cause a significant improvement in her choreoathetotic perioral and arm movements .
She still has significant myoclonic component in her arms especially with volition , but this med will certainly be continued .
While essentially what we ARE hoping for in this use of the med is extra-pyramidal side effects , she should be monitored for any excessive or debilitating parkinsonian symptoms such as excessive rigidity .
Stable
