Report Status :
Signed Discharge

<DATE>03/24/1995</DATE>
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. <PATIENT>Tennis</PATIENT> is a 65-year-old , white male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was admitted to the <HOSPITAL>Utal Health</HOSPITAL> in <DATE>12/92</DATE> for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .
Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions .
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by Dr. <DOCTOR>Kennedy</DOCTOR> with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to OM of the left circumflex .
The vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality .
He has had numerous interval admissions to <HOSPITAL>Shoreale Medical Health</HOSPITAL> for congestive heart failure of an increasing pattern in <DATE>03/93</DATE> and <DATE>08/94</DATE> and then every three weeks since the beginning of the year .
His primary event complaints are episodes of shortness of breath with neck pain without radiation but with dizziness , light-headedness , pallor , and some chest pressure .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He also complains of 30-yard dyspnea on exertion and one-block claudication .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. <DOCTOR>Carbon</DOCTOR> , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
His Procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on Amiodarone .
However , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .
The night before admission , his blood pressure was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 .
He took Nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms .
He came to the Emergency Room for evaluation .
In the Emergency Room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% O2 saturation .
He was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Iron deficiency anemia .
Hypertension .
Urosepsis in 1982 .
Peptic ulcer disease , resulting in gastrectomy .
A 65% stenosis of his proximal right internal carotid artery in <DATE>12/92</DATE> .
Cataract surgery in his righteye .
A 2.5-cm. abdominal aortic aneurysm which was recently sizedat 3.5 cm .
ALLERGIES :
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Smoker for greater than 100 pack years ( 3-1/2 packs per day x 35 years ) .
No ethanol history .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative for diabetes , hypertension , or coronary artery disease .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Otherwise nonfocal .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Digoxin 0.25 mg. p.o. q. a.m. Coumadin 7.5 mg. p.o. q. d. Captopril 25 mg. p.o. q.i.d. Lasix 160 mg. in the morning and 80 mg. at night .
Atenolol 25 mg. p.o. q. a.m. K-Tab 20 mEq. t.i.d. Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. Procainamide , recently discontinued .
Isordil 10 mg. p.o. t.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was a moderately obese man in acute respiratory distress .
Blood pressure was 154/90 in the right and 150/82 in the left .
Pulse was varying between 120 and 140 .
He was afebrile .
His respiratory rate was 20 .
Saturation was 98% in room air .
On HEENT exam , pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation .
Extraocular movements were intact .
He had a furrowed tongue , but hisoropharynx was otherwise negative .
He had no carotid bruits with good bilateral upstroke .
His JVP was difficult to assess with a questionable meniscus near the ear at 45 degrees .
Cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate .
The PMI was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .
Heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .
An S2 split was not appreciated .
There was no apparent S3 .
Chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .
Abdomen was obese .
Abdominal exam revealed surgical scars and questionable hepatojugular reflux .
Liver was 10 cm. in width , 2 to 3 cm. below the rib .
Rectal exam was heme negative .
Extremities were warm with good distal pulses .
Neurologic exam was non focal .
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact .
Reflexes were less than 1+ symmetrically .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , hematocrit was 40 , white count 7.18 , platelets 250 , sodium 138 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 31 , creatinine 1.5 .
Digoxin level was 1.3 .
The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable P-R interval , QRS of 0.09 , and QTC of 0.42 .
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was loaded on Amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed .
His left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to OM was not detected by the aortic root shot .
The ejection fraction was not calculated .
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed , and his medications were tailored over the course of the following 48 hours by following the appropriate parameters .
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no EKG changes during these episodes .
On <DATE>3/22</DATE> , after an appropriate load of Amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .
There were no complications from this procedure , and he remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of discharge .
He was reloaded back upon Coumadin and reached a therapeutic INR .
He was discharged on <DATE>March 24th</DATE> with follow-up of his PT / PTT values on Friday , the <DATE>25th</DATE> , as well as three times a week in the following week , and follow-up with Dr. <DOCTOR>Most</DOCTOR> within two weeks .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Amiodarone 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for the first two weeks , decreasing to 200 mg. p.o. q.d. in the subsequent time .
Coumadin 5 mg. p.o. q.h.s. Axid 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d. Nitro paste 2 in chestopical from bedtime until 8:00 a.m.
DISPOSITION :
He was discharged to home .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
