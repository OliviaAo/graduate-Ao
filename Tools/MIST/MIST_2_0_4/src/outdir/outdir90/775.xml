HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PATIENT>Rule</PATIENT> is a 75 year old woman who is status post sigmoid resection for Duke &apos;s C2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on <DATE>7/8/96</DATE> with abdominal pain and neutropenia .
She first presented in <DATE>April of 1990</DATE> with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke &apos;s B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .
She then represented in <DATE>March of 1996</DATE> with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .
She underwent a sigmoid resection on <DATE>5/17/96</DATE> by Dr. <DOCTOR>Lenni Pain</DOCTOR> .
At the time of surgery there was no evidence of liver disease .
Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .
One of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .
She was therefore staged Dukes C2 .
An abdominal CT scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .
A chest x-ray was read as clear .
She is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .
She presented to the Hematology / Oncology Clinic on <DATE>6/5/96</DATE> for evaluation of possible adjuvant chemotherapy .
She began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .
She was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of Dr. <DOCTOR>Aacent Slentjae</DOCTOR> of the <HOSPITAL>Linatpromehack Worth Hospital</HOSPITAL> for Radiation Therapy .
She began treatment on <DATE>6/20/96</DATE> .
She subsequently had three days of IV bolus 5-FU chemotherapy on <DATE>June 25th</DATE> , <DATE>26th</DATE> and <DATE>27th of 1996</DATE> , which she tolerated well .
Her course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of <DATE>June</DATE> .
She had unremarkable lumbosacral films , except for degenerative joint disease .
An MRI was performed on <DATE>6/25/96</DATE> to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .
However , they were unable to rule out a soft tissue abnormality at L5 encroaching on a neural foramen .
She presented to the <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> Emergency Room on <DATE>7/8/96</DATE> with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .
She denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in 1992.
(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .
Cardiac catheterization showed sequential LAD and she underwent angioplasty twice to the LAD with good results .
An echocardiogram in <DATE>June of 1994</DATE> showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% .
Her baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block .
(3) Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
(4) Osteoporosis .
(5) Hypercholesterolemia .
(6) History of herpes zoster .
(7) Status post appendectomy .
(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
A KUB performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .
However , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .
This was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .
These findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .
She was admitted and made NPO .
On admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 .
She was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
Her ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .
She was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .
She was also placed on neutropenic precautions .
She continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs .
However , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .
By <DATE>7/15/96</DATE> she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .
By <DATE>7/18/96</DATE> she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued .
She was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on TPN .
Of note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .
Of note , shortly after starting on her TPN her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and TPN was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .
She was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
We recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .
During this time she will continue to receive TPN .
After that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .
Her small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Insulin sliding scale b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day , Neutra-phos 500 mg p.o. q. day , metopromide 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets one sublingually q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , nizatidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea , nafcillin dose 4 mg in 24 hours , and TPN .
Make sure her TPN at this point is 6% amino acids and 15% dextrose and 400 kilo calories of lipids , total volume is 1.6 liters and it is to be administered over 20 hours .
In addition to the above , she has the following additives :
20 mm/liter of potassium phosphate , 30.8 mEq per liter of potassium chloride , 30 mEq per liter of sodium chloride , 8 mEq per liter of magnesium sulfate , 94 ng per liter of calcium , 10 ml per day of multivitamins , 10 mg of vitamin K every Monday , 1 ml per day of trace elements , and 22 units of Regular insulin .
Therefore , her total potassium is 60 mEq per liter , total sodium is 30 , and total phosphate is 20 .
Ms. <PATIENT>Rule</PATIENT> is to follow-up with Dr. <DOCTOR>Chelkjescchalsere</DOCTOR> , who can be reached at <PHONE>148-701-5440</PHONE> .
