HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PATIENT>Counts</PATIENT> has known metastatic breast cancer and has been on treatment with Fareston and Aredia .
On the day she was seen for her regular office evaluation and treatment , she was noted to be very slightly confused , nauseated , vomiting , and dehydrated .
Laboratory studies were obtained which showed that she was hypercalcemic and mildly azotemic .
Her calcium was 16.6 with an albumin of 2.5 and her creatinine was 2.6 .
She was admitted to the hospital and given intravenous Saline and then Lasix .
She was also treated with Calcitonin .
During this hospitalization with hydration and diuresis , her calcium fell to normal levels and her renal function corrected to normal .
It was felt that the cause of her hypercalcemia is related to progression of metastatic breast cancer and possibly as a flare to Fareston .
The Fareston was discontinued , Lupron 7.5 mg monthly was initiated and Arimidex 1 mg PO q.d. was initiated .
She was able to tolerate these medicines quite well .
In addition , we started her on Taxol 80 mg per meter square with the first dose administered on <DATE>01/30/2000</DATE> and to be continued as an outpatient .
She complained of some pain in her left lower extremity .
Deep venous thrombosis was shown by color flow Doppler and she was started on Fragmin and Coumadin during this hospitalization .
Fragmin will be continued as an outpatient until the Coumadin dose is established and then this can be discontinued .
The patient was discharged home with nursing care and will be followed by Dr. <DOCTOR>Fyfesaul</DOCTOR> with her first appointment on <DATE>02/06/2000</DATE> .
We will continue her on treatment with Taxol .
Lupron and Arimidex were continued .
