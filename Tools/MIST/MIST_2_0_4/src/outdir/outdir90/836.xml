LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium was 130 , potassium was 2.0 , phosphorus was 1.8 , magnesium was 1.0 , SGOT was 41 , hematocrit was 34.6 , white blood count was 3.4 , platelet count was 134,000 , chest X-ray was clear .
Head CAT-scan :
No progression of toxoplasmosis , multiple abnormalities consistent with PML .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Malnutrition / cachexia/diarrhea / Cryptosporidiosis .
The patient was treated with PPN and elemental diet , for correction of metabolic disturbances , improved fluid balance , and nutritional support .
Paromomycin was continued until his supply was used up , and charithromycin was continued .
AZT was initiated .
Stool was negative for Cryptosporidium .
His diarrhea diminished .
He developed urinary retention and abdominal pain , which resolved with discontinuation of Lomotil .
However , KUB showed persistent change , consistent with ileus or early partial small bowel obstruction .
As he improved symptomatically and was able to take po without discomfort , it was decided to follow him clinically .
On this admission and on previous outpatient laboratory data , potassium and phosphorus tended to be very low so Neutra-Phos K was continued at discharge .
Lomotil was held at discharge because of question of ileus , but may be reinstituted at a very low dose , for example , 1-2 per day .
Coincident with peripheral parenteral nutrition , the patient developed severe facial swelling , as well as an extreme increase in Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma lesions , with almost total engulfing of his teeth .
He was treated with Vincristine , followed several days later by Bleomycin , with return of his condition to somewhat better than baseline on admission .
It was planned to give him one more dose of Vincristine prior to discharge .
3. Pancytopenia :
There was a decrease in CBC , which was ascribed to AZT , which was discontinued .
4. Chronic VZV :
Biopsy of right lower extremity lesion showed VZV .
Acyclovir was initiated .
5. AIDS / disposition :
The patient &apos;s prognosis is very poor and was discussed with the patient and family .
Doses of medications were adjusted to his weight .
Arrangements were made for hospice care locally , with the hope that the patient could move to <LOCATION>Lacin , South Dakota</LOCATION> for continuing care by his sisters there .
