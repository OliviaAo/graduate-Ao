HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Dehydration .
The patient was mildly dehydrated at time of admission and was replaced with intravenous fluids until she began taking good PO intake .
By the end of her hospitalization she was eating well on her own .
2. Infectious Disease .
Admission urinalysis revealed 5-10 red blood cells , 10-20 white blood cells and few bacteria .
Therefore the patient was started on Bactrim for urinary tract infection .
She did not tolerate oral medication initially and was switched to intravenous ampicillin .
The antibiotics were discontinued after three days of intravenous antibiotic therapy .
A repeat urinalysis done later in the course of the hospitalization revealed no white blood cells .
3. Psychiatric .
The patient underwent neuropsychiatric testing .
This evaluation revealed a woman with multifaceted loss of intellectual functioning who falls well within the range of SDAT group .
Conclusion was that this was a dementing process .
The testing was performed by a staff neuropsychologist , Dr. <DOCTOR>Lornsook Trusmoag</DOCTOR> , PhD , telephone number <PHONE>959-1490</PHONE> .
She stated that she would be happy to reevaluate Ms. <PATIENT>Fleetheesc</PATIENT> in the future if necessary .
4. Parotid swelling .
Approximately five days into the hospital stay it was noted that the patient had significant right parotid swelling .
Plain films revealed soft tissue swelling , neck and face computerized tomography scan revealed a nonspecific enlarged right parotid gland with increased attenuation consistent with an inflammatory or neoplastic process .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so a contrast study was not available .
The patient was evaluated by ENT who felt that her enlargement was more likely secondary to an inflammatory process although they could not rule out malignancy .
Cytology consult was called , but by the time the cytologist came to do a fine needle aspiration the mass had shrunken to the point where there was nothing to aspirate .
It was felt that attempting a biopsy and beginning antibiotic treatment was not indicated at this time as the mass had entirely resolved .
The ENT physician who saw the patient is Dr. <DOCTOR>Freieslowkays</DOCTOR> .
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. <DOCTOR>Freieslowkays</DOCTOR> on <DATE>January 8 , 1994</DATE> at 1:20 p.m. at the <HOSPITAL>Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital</HOSPITAL> .
The phone number is <PHONE>610-7597</PHONE> .
5. Physical Therapy .
The patient &apos;s baseline is that she is able to walk with the assistance of her brother or sister at home .
However , she has been reluctant to even move from the bed to the chair since admission to the <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
Physical Therapy has been working with her .
Fear of falling seems to be a large component of this , and the patient will likely need considerable patience in convincing her it is okay to get out of bed again .
