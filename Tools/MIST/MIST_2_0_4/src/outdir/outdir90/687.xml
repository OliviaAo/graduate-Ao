HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 79 year old female whose cardiac risk factors include hyperlipidemia , hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , positive family history .
She had a minimally invasive single vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1998 , consisting of a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending .
In <DATE>03/09</DATE> , she was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Abrat Hospital</HOSPITAL> with a myocardial infarction , complicated by cardiogenic shock .
She had cardiac catheretization at that time , which revealed patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , a dominant left circumflex artery , with an 80% stenosis and a patent right coronary artery .
She underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement to the left circumflex artery .
On <DATE>10/30/02</DATE> she presented to the <HOSPITAL>Abrat Hospital</HOSPITAL> again , with acute onset of shortness of breath while at rest , without other associated symptoms .
She was diuresed and underwent cardiac catheterization , reported as a 90% right coronary artery stenosis , 100% native left anterior descending , patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , sclerotiic distal LAD , 80% mid left circumflex stenosis ; posterior descending artery of 40% and 80% sequentially .
Echocardiogram at <HOSPITAL>Abrat Hospital</HOSPITAL> showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with anteroapical aneurysm , EF of 20% , mild left atrial dilatation , aorticsclerosis and mild pulmonary hypertension .
She was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Bri Health</HOSPITAL> for Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , plus / minus brachy therapy .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
This is a 79 year old female , with acute distress .
BLOOD PRESSURE 110/60 , heart rate 60 , irregular .
HEENT - PERRLA , EOMI .
Neck was soft and supple .
JVP flat .
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with mildly diminished breath sounds at the bases .
S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen soft , with positive bowel sounds .
No bruits audible .
Lower extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
2+ bilateral femoral pulses without bruits .
LAB DATA RADIOLOGY :
Na 136 , K 4.5 , Cl 97 , CO2 26.7 .
BUN 29 , creat 1.7 .
Digoxin 1.0 , WBC 8.5 , hematocrit 34.5 , hemoglobin 11.2 , platelets 289 .
PT 13.7 / PTT 26.3 .
ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
This patent was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Memasound Honvanta Hospital</HOSPITAL> .
On <DATE>11/8/02</DATE> she underwent a Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex in stent restenosis with a 3.0 x 10.0 cutting balloon and then underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the distal left circumflex lesion , followed by deployment of the 2.0 x 13.0 mm Pixel stent .
Following post deployment inflation , the vessel was at full volume without clot or dissection , and TIMI 3 flow .
She was maintained on Integrilin for 12 hours ; her sheaths were removed without difficulty .
After sheath removal , she was started on Fragmin in anticipation of maintaining anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation .
She felt right leg weakness during the procedure , but experienced a great deal of difficulty the following morning , ambulating to the bathroom due to this weakness , which resolved after 2-3 hours .
She was seen in consultation by Neurology .
She underwent head CT which showed old lacunes and bilateral basal ganglia and ? of small hypodensity in the left frontal lobe .
After her right lower extremity weakness resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .
She had no further neurologic symptoms .
Post cath she developed contrast induced acute renal failure , with peak creat of 2.3 .
She was seen in consultation by the Renal service who followed along closely .
Eventually she had renal MRA which was reported as showing severe right renal artery stenosis .
In order to evaluate this , on <DATE>10/21</DATE> she underwent renal MRA which showed only moderate right renal artery stenosis that was non-obstructive .
Following the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .
There was no evidence of GI bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .
She was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .
This echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .
She was seen in consultation by PT , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .
She was found to have a 4 x normal risk of falling , which was felt to be significant .
She however is at increased risk for further embolic phenomenon with atrial fibrillation .
She was maintained on Fragmin and will be considered for lowdose Coumadin once the Plavix is finished in a month if her gait and strength have improved .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
She is ready for discharge to a nursing facility for further strength training .
