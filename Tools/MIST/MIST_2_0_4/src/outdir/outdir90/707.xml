DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
ASCENDING AORTIC DISSECTION PROCEDURE PERFORMED :
<DATE>07/26/97</DATE> , repair of chronic type A aortic dissection with selective circulatory arrest using a right axillary artery cannulation and innominate artery occlusion , reconstruction of non coronary sinus ( super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 ) , reinforced with felt strip .
Primary repair of atrioseptal defect , patent foramen ovale .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PATIENT>List</PATIENT> is a 67 year-old diabetic woman with a known thoracic aortic dissection .
On <DATE>December 29 , 1996</DATE> , the patient developed abdominal and back pain and presented to <HOSPITAL>Drain Hospital</HOSPITAL> .
A dissected descending thoracic aorta was diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiogram .
The patient was transferred to <HOSPITAL>En&apos;s Healthcare</HOSPITAL> for work-up .
She was intubated with pulmonary edema and followed by serial examinations .
The patient refused surgery per report .
<DATE>January 4</DATE> , a CT scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , parenchymal consolidation right greater than left , aortic dissection with true and false lumens , well delineated flap with compression of the true lumen secondary to mass effect of thrombus in the false lumen .
There was a mediastinal hematoma .
There was a low density abnormality surrounding the ascending aorta .
<DATE>January 23 , 1996</DATE> , the patient had a CT scan , again showing ascending aorta with low density abnormality , with findings suspicious for involvement of the ascending aorta by dissection , bilateral pleural effusions were improved .
The patient has had dyspnea on exertion since <DATE>January , 1996</DATE> , increasing in the last month , and increasing abdominal distention .
The patient denies history of myocardial infarction or chest pain .
She does have shortness of breath and pedal edema .
She has had atrial fibrillation for five years .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She does orthopnea of three to four pillows .
No syncope but she occasionally has dizziness .
The patient underwent CT scan on <DATE>Jul 24 , 1997</DATE> , which demonstrated dissection of the ascending and archaorta to the root .
CT scan also demonstrated stable descending thoracic dissection with resolution of luminal compression .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
Congestive heart failure .
Atrial fibrillation .
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
Hypertension .
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Hiatal hernia .
History of gastrointestinal bleed on aspirin .
Status post appendectomy .
Status post umbilical hernia repair .
Status postventral hernia repair .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
History of 40 pack years smoking , quit in <DATE>December , 1996</DATE> .
Occasional ethanol .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfa , which gives her a rash .
Her medications on admission were aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Lopressor 50 milligrams p.o.b.i.d. ; Glyburide 2.5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Premarin 0.625 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Lasix 40 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Trandate 200 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Prevacid 30 milligrams p.o. q.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is in no acute distress .
Blood pressure is 138/72 .
She is on room air at 90% .
Oropharynx showed poor dentition with apparent decay of the remaining teeth and gum recession .
Neck showed 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits , increased jugular venous distention .
The lungs demonstrated wheezes on auscultation with crackles at the bases .
Cardiovascular was irregularly irregular rhythm and rate .
Holosystolic murmur , II / VI , at the left lower sternal border .
The abdomen was obese , protuberant , nontender with well-healed surgical scars .
Extremities showed no clubbing or cyanosis .
There was pedal edema to the ankles bilaterally .
Varicosities particularly left lower extremity front and back and right upper extremity medially .
There were 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally , 2+ radial pulses bilaterally .
Neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Significant for white blood cell count of 6.8. BUN 14 , creatinine 1 .
Liver function tests were within normal limits .
Urinalysis was negative .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 102 with an old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for preoperative work-up prior to planned repair of her ascending aortic dissection .
Given her history reported from outside source of a bleeding diathesis , Hematology consult was obtained who felt that she had no evidence of qualitative abnormality orcoagulopathy .
The patient was evaluated by the Dental Service , who felt that it was necessary to extract several teeth and to follow several more , specifically tooth 15 and 16 , that were fully impacted .
The patient received periprocedure antibiotics .
The patient underwent echocardiogram on <DATE>Jul 25 , 1997</DATE> , demonstrating 2/4+ tricuspid regurgitation with a peak velocity of 2.9 ; mitral regurgitation 2/4 , mild concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle ; no systolic function with mild septal hypokinesis .
The ejection fraction was estimated at 55% .
The aortic valve appeared sclerotic with mild to moderate insufficiency .
The ascending aorta appeared severely dilated immediately after the root at 7.7 centimeters .
Dissection flap was noted .
There was pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 34 mmHg plus right atrial pressure .
There was also evidence of a secundum type atrioseptal defect , approximately 0.5 centimeters in size , with elevated right atrial pressure .
The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization on <DATE>Jul 25 , 1997</DATE> , demonstrating elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 19 , right ventricular pressure of 56/19 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/39 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24/26/21 .
Evidence of atrioseptal defect again was noted with a calculation of 2:1 .
Non selective coronary arteriography performed did not reveal the presence of any focal coronary artery disease .
The aortic root angiography revealed the presence of an extensive ascending aortic dissection .
True lumen could not be accessed from either the left or right femoral artery .
The true lumen required access by right radial artery and tortuous innominate artery .
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on <DATE>Jul 26 , 1997</DATE> , where she underwent resection and repair of chronic aortic dissection and reconstruction of the super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 as well as primary repair of an atrioseptal defect which appeared consistent with a patent foramen ovale and was 1-2 centimeters insize .
On postoperative day number one , however , the patient was hemodynamically stable on a small amount of heparin and nitroglycerin with a cardiac index of 3 .
The patient required diuresis in her course after receiving multiple blood products .
Beta blocker was started as well .
The patient was transferred to the floor after a slow ventilator wean .
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number three .
She did demonstrate evidence of a right brachial neuropathy , likely associated with the extensive dissection required for access to the right axillary artery , given the patient &apos;s distorted anatomy due to the large dissection .
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and received therapy to the right upper extremity and hand .
She will require continued therapy .
Otherwise the patient was neurologically intact .
She has worked well with Physical Therapy with regard to ambulation and has tolerated a regular diet without difficulty .
The patient was in persistent atrial fibrillation postoperatively .
The determination was made not to Coumadinize the patient given herchronic descending thoracic dissection and history of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient has been chronically in atrial fibrillation preoperatively without Coumadin therapy .
The patient did require extensive pulmonary toilet and she continues to benefit from nebulizer therapy , chest physiotherapy and diuresis .
On 2 liters nasal cannulaoxygen , she is saturating at 93-95% .
The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation for reconditioning in general and specifically in regard to her right upper extremity .
She will follow-up with Dr. <DOCTOR>Spotted</DOCTOR> in four to six weeks ; with her cardiologist in one week .
