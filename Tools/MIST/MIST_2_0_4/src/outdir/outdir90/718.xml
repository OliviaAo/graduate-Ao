HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the <HOSPITAL>Lemgarson Hospital</HOSPITAL> service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until <DATE>January 26</DATE> when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at <HOSPITAL>Va Sit Namar Healthcare</HOSPITAL> and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the <DATE>2th</DATE> the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. <DOCTOR>Joasscchird</DOCTOR> , tel. <PHONE>090-249-6079</PHONE> , at <HOSPITAL>Va Sit Namar Healthcare</HOSPITAL> and Dr. <DOCTOR>Acrookesjo</DOCTOR> at <HOSPITAL>Do Of Hospital</HOSPITAL> , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with <HOSPITAL>AH</HOSPITAL> and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. <DOCTOR>Acrookesjo</DOCTOR> in one week and Dr. <DOCTOR>Work</DOCTOR> the gastrointestinal fellow here at <HOSPITAL>PUOMC</HOSPITAL> in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .
Zoloft 50 mg PO QD , Lactulose 15 g PO BID , Synthroid 0.15 mg PO QD , Prilosec 20 mg PO BID .
