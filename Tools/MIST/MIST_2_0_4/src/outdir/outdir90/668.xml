PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE :
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 73 year old white female with a history of pancreatic cancer treated with 5-FU and a vague history of chest pain , admitted with EKG changes of unclear duration , consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction .
In <DATE>March of 1989</DATE> , she presented with painless jaundice , and a workup included pancreatic cancer .
She underwent a Whipple procedure and a cholecystectomy .
In <DATE>January of 1989</DATE> , she was begun on 5-FU for five days of treatment followed by three weeks of no treatment .
Since then , she has had occasional lower sternal chest pain when lying on her side , reproducible by palpation .
Two weeks prior to admission , she had a presyncopal episode but did not lose consciousness .
There were no other symptoms .
One day prior to admission , she was seen at the <HOSPITAL>Dagreat Health</HOSPITAL> for 5-FU , her third cycle .
She complained of chest pain and back pain , and an EKG was obtained which showed new Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , and T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , consistent with an anterior septal myocardial infarction .
She was reviewed by the cardiologists and was admitted for further evaluation of her myocardial infarction .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Include smoking and increased cholesterol .
There is no diabetes , hypertension , or family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes (1) pancreatic cancer , status post a Whipple procedure , on 5-FU .
(3) Fibrocystic breast disease .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Include 5-FU and Percocet for pain , Zantac , and Simethicone .
She has no known drug allergies .
She smoked up until ten years ago .
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is an elderly white female in no apparent distress with a temperature of 97.6 , blood pressure 122/70 , heart rate of 72 , and a respiratory rate of 20 .
Her physical examination is notable for an essentially entirely normal physical examination .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , includes a white blood cell count of 5.6 , hematocrit 37.4 , platelets 312 .
Her electrolytes were within normal limits .
The CK was 89 .
The urinalysis showed 5-10 white blood cells .
There were two red blood cells .
The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 75 , axis -30 degrees , Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , new in comparison to <DATE>June of 1985</DATE> .
The chest x-ray showed a slightly increased cardiac size .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the <HOSPITAL>Dagreat Health</HOSPITAL> Service where she ruled out for a myocardial infarction by CK &apos;s and LDH &apos;s .
However , her EKG &apos;s did progress to T-wave inversions in V1-V6 , and it was felt that the patient most likely had at some point had a myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram was done which showed apical septal akinesis , but with well preserved systolic function .
Her medicines could not be increased beyond low doses secondary to a low systolic blood pressure .
Just prior to discharge , she underwent an exercise tolerance test with a modified Bruce protocol where she went seven minutes and seventeen seconds , and stopped secondary to fatigue .
She did not have any chest pain or EKG changes , however , hermaximal heart rate was 71 , and her blood pressure was 110/60 .
It was felt by the cardiologist on the case that this was more exercise than she usually did at home , and she was comfortable with the current medical regimen .
PROBLEM # 2 :
PANCREATIC CANCER .
The patient will be continued on her 5-FU as an outpatient , to be followed by Dr. <DOCTOR>Liermfelsbelb</DOCTOR> .
Lumbosacral spines done during the admission did not show any change from x-rays done previously .
PROBLEM # 3 :
HISTORY OF DIZZINESS .
The patient complained of some dizziness and had a presyncopal episode prior to admission , however , the patient felt that her dizziness was unchanged from the dizziness that she had for several years .
She will be followed up by Dr. <DOCTOR>Liermfelsbelb</DOCTOR> .
PROBLEM # 4 :
ANEMIA .
The patient had an anemia on admission .
She had normal iron and TIBC .
Reticulocyte count is pending at the time of this dictation .
I suspect that this is anemia of chronic disease , but could not rule out gastrointestinal blood loss , although she remained guaiac negative .
PROBLEM # 5 :
PYURIA .
The patient 8-10 white blood cells in the urine on admission , and the urine culture was no growth so far at the time of discharge .
DISPOSITION :
