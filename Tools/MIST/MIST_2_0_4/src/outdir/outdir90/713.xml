A 2D echocardiogram showed mitral stenosis with a peak gradient of 23 , mean of 15 and a calculated mitral valve area of 0.9 cm. squared .
Her echo score was 10 .
There was more involvement of the lateral commissure and mild mitral regurgitation .
She also had mild aortic insufficiency , moderate tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 74 .
She is now referred for PMV .

SUMMARY :
This was a woman with mitral stenosis referred for PMV .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where she was found to have a valve area of 0.6 cm. squared with a mean gradient of 20 .
She underwent successful PMV with a valve area increasing to 1.2 cm. squared and a gradient being reduced to 12 .
She had her sheathes removed without incident and was transferred to the floor for observation overnight .
She did well overnight with no chest pain or shortness of breath .
She had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed prior to discharge , the results of which are pending at the time of this dictation .
