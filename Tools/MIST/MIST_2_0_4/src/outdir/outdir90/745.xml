DISCHARGE DATE :
<DATE>12/03/96</DATE>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Sepsis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
End-stage renal disease ; diabetes mellitus ; necrotizing fasciitis of the right leg and pelvis ; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ; hypertension ; asthma ; atrial fibrillation ; peripheral vascular disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<DATE>8/22/96</DATE> , drainage of intraabdominal abscess .
<DATE>8/21/96</DATE> , incision and drainage of right thigh .
<DATE>9/3/96</DATE> , transverse colostomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
<PATIENT>Daie Elms</PATIENT> was a 50-year-old male , who underwent cadaveric renal transplant in 1992 , who presented with a three-week old scrape of the right popliteal fossa related to a prosthesis .
The wound became progressively indurated with drainage , and he presented for evaluation and treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ; hypertension ; peripheral vascular disease ; coronary artery disease ; bilateral vitrectomies ; cadaveric renal transplant ; suprapubic tube for ureteral necrosis ; status post right below-knee amputation and left below-knee amputation ; asthma ; atrial fibrillation ; left arm arteriovenous fistula .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Cyclosporin A .
Prednisone .
Procardia .
Digoxin .
Pravachol .
Imuran .
Lasix .
Epogen .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an obese man in no acute distress .
His blood pressure was 174/60 ; temperature 103.4 .
The chest examination was remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally , with regular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination .
Extremity examination revealed bilateral below-knee amputations with a 2 x 4 centimeter area of inflammation in the right popliteal fossa with a draining sinus .
Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
At the time of admission , BUN and creatinine were 89 and 4.4 ; white blood count 19.3 ; hematocrit 21.9 ; PT 15.1 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. <PATIENT>Elms</PATIENT> was admitted to the hospital , and after multiple cultures were drawn , he was subsequently taken to the operating room on <DATE>8/21/96</DATE> for incision and drainage of a right thigh abscess .
Cultures from his abdomen subsequently grew out methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas .
His clinical condition continued to worsen with evidence of ongoing sepsis and renal failure , which transiently improved on hemodialysis , but generally progressively worsened .
On <DATE>9/3/96</DATE> , he underwent a transverse colostomy to allow diversion from the nonhealing leg and pelvis wounds .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
His nutrition remained poor throughout this time in spite of numerous attempts at enteral alimentation .
On <DATE>11/26/96</DATE> , the patient had a hypotensive bradycardic arrest at the end of a dialysis run .
He was intubated at this time and could not be extubated thereafter .
He became increasingly more unresponsive and remained quite septic and febrile , resistant to aggressive antibiotic treatment .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
Over the next two days , Mr. <PATIENT>Elms</PATIENT> was kept comfortable and given intravenous fluids and tube feeds , but he remained extremely ill .
He had no spontaneous cardiac or neurologic activity at this time , and he was declared dead at 12:15 A.M. on <DATE>12/3/96</DATE> .
The family was notified , but declined a postmortem examination .
