CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE .
Unsigned
Report Status :
ADMISSION DATE :
congestive heart failure .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
aortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency .
Sulfonamides .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
cardiac catheterization - <DATE>4/1/93</DATE> - two dimensional echocardiogram <DATE>3/27/93</DATE> .
Mr. <PATIENT>Breun</PATIENT> underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in <DATE>March , 1990</DATE> , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .
He also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .
Despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .
Over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .
There was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .
The right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .
There was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .
The liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .
Later , an echocardiogram on <DATE>3/27/93</DATE> , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .
The left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .
The aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .
There was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .
The left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .
There was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .
A Persantine Thallium scan on <DATE>3/31/93</DATE> , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .
LABORATORY DATA :
This was of uncertain significance .
The hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on <DATE>4/1/93</DATE> .
There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .
The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .
The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .
The saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .
He seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<DATE>08-23-92</DATE>
Status post resection of a cerebellar medulloblastoma .
At baseline , he had lived with his guardians , <PATIENT>Pandeprob</PATIENT> , he was &quot; slow &quot; , walked with a very ataxic gait , did not talk much and spends most of his time watching TV and smoking .
A recent head computerized tomography scan in <DATE>01/92</DATE> was negative .
He had been evaluated by his local medical doctor for his weight loss .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Cerebellar brain carcinoma , status post surgery , chemotherapy and radiation therapy six to seven years ago .
He had not had any recurrence .
There was no cardiac disease , hypertension or diabetes mellitus .
He had no known drug allergies .
None .
The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation .
Extremities - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The discs were flat .
There was no retinopathy .
He had a gag and good palpate movement .
The tongue was midline .
There was a right facial droop which was mild .
LABORATORY DATA :
The head computerized tomography scan without contrast showed a 3 x 3 x 5 cm. hemorrhage extending form the left Sylvian fissure and put amen to the left front oparietal lobe .
There was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .
His blood pressure was not elevated .
The aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and B12 .
Once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .
An magnetic resonance imaging study on <DATE>07/17/92</DATE> showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .
The medial region of the hematoma was felt to be suspicious for tumor versus arteriovenous malformation .
Given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar mass .
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest I minus on <DATE>7/27/92</DATE> did not show the mass initially noted .
A cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for mass effect from the hematoma .
A testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for mass .
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and G-tube was performed at the same time .
There was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .
An abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non-enhancing .
Initially , the patient remained drowsy until Decadron was added to his medical regimen .
He awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .
He was started on Dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .
He needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .
His pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .
There was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .
He had limited vertical up gaze .
His gag was intact with palatal movements .
On repetitive testing with Speech Therapy had not been able to swallow in a safe manner .
Thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .
He squints with his left eye when he tries to focus and claims this is because he sees double .
His deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the right with 3 right brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and patella .
On the left , his reflexes wee 2-2+ with a downgoing toe .
It was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .
The patient will be discharged to <HOSPITAL>Limestrict T Pio Medical Center</HOSPITAL> and will be followed by Dr. <DOCTOR>Mo Muell</DOCTOR> in one month in the Neurologic Clinic .
