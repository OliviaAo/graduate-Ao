Report Status :
ADMISSION DATE :
<DATE>04-09-94</DATE>
He was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in <DATE>August</DATE> of l988 .
He was treated at that time with TPA .
He again did well until approximately late l992 .
He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .
His angiograms from <HOSPITAL>Morehegron Valley Hospital</HOSPITAL> from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
Specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .
Following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .
He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .
He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .
Following that admission in <DATE>October</DATE> he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
He had multiple admissions to the <HOSPITAL>Morehegron Valley Hospital</HOSPITAL> once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .
His medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .
His most recent admission to the <HOSPITAL>Morehegron Valley Hospital</HOSPITAL> is on <DATE>April 5</DATE> , of 1994 .
Because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> on <DATE>4-9-94</DATE> .
There is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .
Of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .
His medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .
His blood pressure l60/90 .
His jugular venous pressure was normal .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
He had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
Normal chloride and CO2 .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .
To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on <DATE>4-10-94</DATE> , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .
The right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .
That is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .
After an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. <PATIENT>Leach</PATIENT> &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Because of the ongoing nature of his pain .
He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .
Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .
He was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
Because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .
Prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on <DATE>May 13</DATE> .
That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .
On the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .
That was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .
This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .
After extended discussions with pain service , Mr. <PATIENT>Leach</PATIENT> was brought back down to the pain clinic on <DATE>October 27</DATE> .
There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .
Once again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .
The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .
He had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on <DATE>May 27 , 1995</DATE> .
1. Unstable angina secondary to syndrome X .
2. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia as well as epicardial coronary artery disease .
Left thorascopic sympathectomy on <DATE>May 21</DATE> and cardiac catheterization and coronary angiograph and left ventriculography on <DATE>April 10 , 1994</DATE> .
