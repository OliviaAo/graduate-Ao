Thoracoabdominal aneurysm .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
<DATE>2/17/94</DATE> :
The patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on <DATE>11/18/93</DATE> at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the <HOSPITAL>Eifro Medical Center</HOSPITAL> which was evaluated with a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan .
The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on <DATE>12/31/93</DATE> via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .
The patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Extremities :
are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .
Neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .
EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .
Her chest X-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .
There were no intraoperative complications .
The patient remained intubated postoperatively .
On postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .
Epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .
The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .
This was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .
Neurological consultation was obtained .
It was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .
MRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .
The patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .
She was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .
Continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .
The patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .
Additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the <HOSPITAL>On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
It is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .
