Chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia , no congestive heart failure .
A computerized tomography scan revealed right lower occipital low-density area .
Head magnetic resonance imaging study and magnetic resonance imaging angiogram obtained on <DATE>May 11 , 1995</DATE> , revealed subacute right lateral occipital lobe infarction and decreased flow related enhancement in the left posterior communicating artery with respect to that on the right .
Holter electrocardiogram :
small wedge-shaped visual field defect in right eye , suggesting retinal lesion .
Echocardiogram revealing segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving inferoseptal , inferior and posterior segments at the base and mid ventricular level .
Overall left ventricle systolic function moderately impaired with and estimated ejection fraction of 35% .
Otherwise , there was pulmonary insufficiency , tricuspid insufficiency , mitral insufficiency and aortic insufficiency .
There were no clots seen on the echocardiogram .
The patient also had serial electrocardiogram , which showed no change .
The patient also had serial creatinine kinase with MB fractions studied , which revealed MB fraction too low to be tested .
This moving sense , with normal electroencephalogram , was thought to be a mild vestibular dysfunction or from the acute episode of the stroke .
The patient will have these symptoms only when the eyes are closed .
The patient did have a hypotensive episode and the systolic blood pressure was 80 , after the patient received his regular cardiac medications .
The patient will be randomized on the Wars study early next week by the Stroke Service at <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient was stable with the physical examination as described above .
Medications - aspirin 325 mg po qd , Glipizide 25 mg po qd .
