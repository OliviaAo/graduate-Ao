PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
3. HYPERTENSION
6. CERVICAL POLYPS
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest <DATE>02/04/94</DATE> .
She was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
In 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in <LOCATION>Hispit , Delaware</LOCATION> .
Since that time the patient has been treated medically .
Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
Coronaries were completely normal .
Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .
Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
By report , in the interim since discharge from <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
Dring this hospitalization at <HOSPITAL>Hahkellrick Hospital</HOSPITAL> , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .
She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> for further evaluation .
The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .
Consequently AICD placement was recommended .
Note , from <DATE>02/22</DATE> to <DATE>03/09</DATE> there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .
Consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .
Thus , AICD placement was performed on <DATE>03/09/94</DATE> following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to <LOCATION>Vonamemp , LA</LOCATION> via plane by herself .
Type II diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps .
ALLERGIES :
Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , digoxin .125 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg q.d. , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , dobutamine 2.3 mg per kilogram per hour , Xanax .25 mg prn , Beclovent 2 puffs q.i.d. , Proventil 2 puffs q.i.d. , K-Dur 20 mEq q.d. , magnesium oxide 400 mg t.i.d. and Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
Positive tobacco history although the patient quit approximately 1 year ago .
History of alcohol formerly 6 pack per day long-standing , however , the patient currently does not use alcohol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
HEENT :
Within normal limits .
NECK :
Supple with 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally , negative for bruits .
Jugular venous pressure approximately 8 cm , negative for lymphadenopathy .
Regular rate and rhythm , II / VI systolic murmur , negative for L3 .
Clear to auscultation bilaterally with an inspiratory squeak at the left lower base .
ABDOMEN :
Negative for clubbing , cyanosis or edema , and 2+ pulses throughout .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 93 , bicarb 34 , BUN 14 , creatinine .8 , glucose 155 , hematocrit 51.3 , platelet count 255 , white count 8.1 .
Digoxin 0.9 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
As mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation .
As per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate .
Cultures were negative .
The patient did well following the AICD placement .
The patient is discharged to home in stable condition on <DATE>03/13/94</DATE> .
