UNIT NUMBER :
ADMISSION DATE :

Hepatitis B-related cirrhosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
(2) Hepatic encephalopathy .
(4) Hepatic hydrothorax on the right .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Chest tube placement on the right .
This is a 60-year-old Mandarin speaking gentleman , with a long history of end-stage liver disease secondary to Hepatitis B. infection diagnosed approximately six years prior to admission , who now presents with recurrence of right-sided hydrothorax thought to be related as an ascitic equivalent on the right side .
The patient has been admitted multiple times with this symptom , and in this setting , was called in to the hospital by his primary care doctor on the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath , and dyspnea on exertion .
He was admitted to the Medical Service where he was found to have a transudative , right-sided effusion thought again to be the equivalent of his ascites on the basis of end-stage liver disease .
It was tapped and drained with placement of a chest tube .
In the Intensive Care Unit , his chest tube continued to have massive volume output , and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid .
His renal function continued to worsen and he developed hypervolemic hyponatremia , and hemodynamic parameters consistent with sepsis .
During the first week of <DATE>February</DATE> in spite of antibiosis , the patient developed worsening renal failure , became anuric , and developed rapid progression in spite of his chest tube of the right-sided hydrothorax in addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome vs. extreme volume overload .
In consultation with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <DOCTOR>Leynslentnerswaimjesc</DOCTOR> and with his gastrointestinal physician , Dr. <DOCTOR>Loydbreunlinke</DOCTOR> , and with the patient &apos;s family , the decision was made in the setting of his grim prognosis and multiple morbidities that further aggressive treatment would not be pursued .
The patient was evaluated for continuous venous venous hemodialysis , which in the end in the setting of the family &apos;s wishes , was not begun with this patient .
The time of death was 5:16 A.M. on the <DATE>27th of February , 1997</DATE> .
Dr. <DOCTOR>Leynslentnerswaimjesc , Lau</DOCTOR> , and <DOCTOR>Launtburce</DOCTOR> were notified .
