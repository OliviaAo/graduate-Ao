DISCHARGE SUMMARY
<PATIENT>TLANDSEUSS , CHERE C</PATIENT>
<ID>083-97-79</ID>
ADMISSION DATE :
<DATE>09/15/1998</DATE>
DISCHARGE DATE :
The patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from <HOSPITAL>Cay Memorial Hospital Of</HOSPITAL> for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of chest pain and in <DATE>January 1993</DATE> underwent a cardiac catheterization at <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
He was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .
He denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
He continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> for further evaluation and management .
Prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
Lisinopril 10 mg bid .
Aspirin .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
He was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .
His lungs were clear throughout .
His apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .
Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .
His creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .
His hematocrit was 49.3 .
His electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .
There were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .
The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .
Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .
His initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .
Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on <DATE>9/17/98</DATE> which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .
He had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .
The patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on <DATE>9/20/98</DATE> .
There was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .
Radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .
He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .
His Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .
After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .
His INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .
Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .
Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .
He was discharged in stable condition on <DATE>9/23/98</DATE> .
FOLLOW-UP :
He will follow-up with Dr. <DOCTOR>Taarnna Service</DOCTOR> at <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> as well as Dr. <DOCTOR>Lupevickette Folk</DOCTOR> and Dr. <DOCTOR>Dwainco Rallsversgach</DOCTOR> on <LOCATION>Villean Garl</LOCATION> .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
Ecotrin 1 qd ( on hold until off of Coumadin ) .
Coumadin 5 mg qhs or as directed for four weeks .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
Aricept 10 mg qhs .
NPH insulin 8 units q am , 5 units q pm .
CZI insulin two units q am .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
