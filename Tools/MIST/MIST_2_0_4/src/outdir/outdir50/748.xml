The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on <DATE>4/27</DATE> .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .

After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <DOCTOR>Douet</DOCTOR> at <HOSPITAL>Vassdiysey Medical Center</HOSPITAL> , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to <HOSPITAL>Vassdiysey Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .
