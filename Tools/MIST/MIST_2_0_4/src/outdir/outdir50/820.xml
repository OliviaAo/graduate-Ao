Discharge Date :
<DATE>04/09/1991</DATE>
EPIGLOTTITIS .
She was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .
She did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
She denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .
She was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .
Apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to <HOSPITAL>Ez Ephtro Health Center</HOSPITAL> where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .
She was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .
She did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .
She was febrile to 101.7 .
ENT consult was obtained .
A lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
Negative .
None .
ALLERGIES :
None .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
Alcohol none .
The patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
Neck :
Otherwise normal and the trachea was midline .
Hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
The left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
No masses .
Back :
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Revealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .
As noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
The chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
She was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
At the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .
She had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .
She was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .
EKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .
She went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .
Otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .
Once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .
After extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
O2 saturations looked good .
Her white counts came down .
Blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .
Her mental status began to clear under the family &apos;s request .
On <DATE>4/9/91</DATE> she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .
Our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .
Discharge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .
