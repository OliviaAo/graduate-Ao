This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
He was later seen by Dr. <DOCTOR>Flo Cuchkote</DOCTOR> at the <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
There was no definite clonic activity .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
no known drug allergies .
2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in World War II .
4) old right frontal infarct .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Tobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use .
He was a previous drinker of one &quot; old fashioned &quot; every night .
FAMILY HISTORY :
There was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .
He was afebrile .
In general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .
oropharynx was intubated with blood as well .
Lungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .
He does not regard the examiner .
He had no blink to threat .
He had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally .
He had no gag to tube manipulation .
Motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
