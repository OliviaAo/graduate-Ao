DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
WORD DISABILITY AND PROBABLY DURATION :
Ms. <PATIENT>Kotereef</PATIENT> is a <AGE>93-year-old</AGE> woman who was transferred from <HOSPITAL>Daleglo Medical Center</HOSPITAL> with renal insufficiency .
The patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
She also has a history of urinary tract infection .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
She also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .
However , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .
Her systolic blood pressure was 110 .
She appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .
The patient had been followed by Dr. <DOCTOR>Friednantflirt</DOCTOR> of the <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
At that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
The patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
Her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .
Her BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
Initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .
However , with the assistance of the patient &apos;s granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .
The patient will be transferred tomorrow to <HOSPITAL>Naplesvillechaelty</HOSPITAL> .
