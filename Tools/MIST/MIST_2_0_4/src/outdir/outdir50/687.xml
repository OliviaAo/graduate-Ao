ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement to the second obtuse marginal artery .
<DATE>11/9/02</DATE> - head CT ; <DATE>11/10</DATE> carotid non-invasive Dopplers .
<DATE>11/12</DATE> - brain MRI .
Nitroglycerine 0.3 mg tab PRN chest pain , Celexa 40 mg PO QD .
Carvedilol 25 mg PO BID .
Lipitor 40 mg PO QD .
Plavix 75 mg PO QD .
Nexium 20 mg PO BID , Diovan 160 mg PO QD .
Lasix , 80 mg PO QD .

Vitamin B-12 500 mcg PO QD .
Digoxin 0.0625 mg PO QD .
In <DATE>03/09</DATE> , she was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Abrat Hospital</HOSPITAL> with a myocardial infarction , complicated by cardiogenic shock .
On <DATE>10/30/02</DATE> she presented to the <HOSPITAL>Abrat Hospital</HOSPITAL> again , with acute onset of shortness of breath while at rest , without other associated symptoms .
She was diuresed and underwent cardiac catheterization , reported as a 90% right coronary artery stenosis , 100% native left anterior descending , patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , sclerotiic distal LAD , 80% mid left circumflex stenosis ; posterior descending artery of 40% and 80% sequentially .
Echocardiogram at <HOSPITAL>Abrat Hospital</HOSPITAL> showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with anteroapical aneurysm , EF of 20% , mild left atrial dilatation , aorticsclerosis and mild pulmonary hypertension .
She was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Bri Health</HOSPITAL> for Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , plus / minus brachy therapy .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
This is a 79 year old female , with acute distress .
O2 hemostasis of 97% , neurological awake , alert and oriented x three but poor short term memory and mild confusion .
JVP flat .
No bruits audible .
Lower extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
LAB DATA RADIOLOGY :
Na 136 , K 4.5 , Cl 97 , CO2 26.7 .
Digoxin 1.0 , WBC 8.5 , hematocrit 34.5 , hemoglobin 11.2 , platelets 289 .
PT 13.7 / PTT 26.3 .
ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response .
This patent was admitted to <HOSPITAL>Memasound Honvanta Hospital</HOSPITAL> .
Following post deployment inflation , the vessel was at full volume without clot or dissection , and TIMI 3 flow .
She was maintained on Integrilin for 12 hours ; her sheaths were removed without difficulty .
MRI was recommended , and on <DATE>11/12</DATE> she underwent an MRI which revealed an acute infarct in the left posterior corona radiata and narrowing at the P2 segment of the right PCA .
After her right lower extremity weakness resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .
She had no further neurologic symptoms .
Following the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .
There was no evidence of GI bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .
She was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .
This echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .
She was seen in consultation by PT , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .
She however is at increased risk for further embolic phenomenon with atrial fibrillation .
She was maintained on Fragmin and will be considered for lowdose Coumadin once the Plavix is finished in a month if her gait and strength have improved .
