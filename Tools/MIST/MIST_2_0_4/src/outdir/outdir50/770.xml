<ID>282-52-89</ID>
ADMISSION DATE :
<DATE>08/05/97</DATE>
DISCHARGE DATE :
Acute myocardial infarction .
urinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , Parkinson &apos;s disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease x &apos;s 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall .
He reports lower abdominal pain x&apos;s 2 days .
They went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> for admission .
He was recently started on a Texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
He had no known drug allergies .
The patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .
He was continued on his Parkinson &apos;s medications .
A head CT was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .
Dr. <DOCTOR>Factor</DOCTOR> agreed he would review the CTs and follow the patient while in house .
He was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .
Thus , he was considered ready for discharge .
He again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .
He was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .
Anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .
He had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .
The right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .
He was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .
He surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .
He was dynamically stable on his Dobutamine with improved oxygenation .
The patient continued fairly stable while intubated .
He had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .
His neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .
They did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .
The repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .
The lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .
Discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .
He was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .
The patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .
No further blood draws were done .
The patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous Morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .
Comfort measures continued until the day <DATE>8/19/97</DATE> , where Mr. <PATIENT>Koteleebdils</PATIENT> was found to be pulseless , without respirations .
He was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on <DATE>8/19/97</DATE> .

1) STATUS POST ANTERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION LEADING TO CARDIAC ARREST .
2) BILATERAL LUNG CARCINOMA .
No metastatic disease , status post one course of chemotherapy with MVP ( Mitomycin-C , Vinblastin , and Platinum ) at the <HOSPITAL>Petersly Hospital And Medical Center</HOSPITAL> .
He was admitted on <DATE>10-29-90</DATE> because of pulmonary edema and ST wave changes .
No lymphadenopathy .
He received chemotherapy in <DATE>09-90</DATE> which he tolerated well .
Since then persistent right chest wall pain .
He was sent to the <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> Emergency Room and was found to have shortness of breath with diaphoresis and left anterior chest pain .
The patient was electively intubated and treated with morphine , Lasix , nitroglycerin , Nitro Paste , and sublingual Nifedipine .
Notable for bilateral apical lung cancer , history of urinary retention with a prostate specific antigen of 21.7 and a right prostate nodule .
None .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
In general the patient was intubated , elderly gentleman on respirator .
HEENT exam showed pupils 1 mm bilateral with arcus lipoides .
Heart exam S4 , S1 , S2 .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for CK 111 with MB 0 .
His CK increased up to 1080 with an MB 63 .
EKG showed ST elevations in leads V3 through V4 with flipped T waves in V2 through V4 .
Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial and alveolar abnormalities predominantly in the perihilar and basilar regions most consistent with CHF and large left perihilar mass and no pneumothorax .
The patient was put on Captopril 12.5 mg po tid .
He was moved off the Intensive Care Unit onto a regular floor .
ETT performed on <DATE>11-6-90</DATE> showed 4 minutes 39 seconds on modified Bruce , stopped because of fatigue , no chest pain .
The patient was ready for discharge , however , on <DATE>11-7-90</DATE> he was found to be in ventricular tachycardia , pulseless , unresponsive .
Medical team had an extensive talk with the patient on <DATE>11-8-90</DATE> concerning his code status .
The patient electively decided not to be intubated nor resuscitated in case of another cardiac or respiratory arrest .
On <DATE>11-9-90</DATE> the patient again had ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .
Since the patient had decided to be do not resuscitate no resuscitation efforts were undertaken and patient was pronounced dead on <DATE>11-9-90</DATE> at 5:10 a.m.
