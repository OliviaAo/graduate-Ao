He was found to have CML .
Unremarkable .
The patient received his bone marrow transplant on <DATE>06/12/00</DATE> .
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On <DATE>06/26/00</DATE> due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .
