An ABG on two liters of oxygen per minute via nasal prong was 7.40 , 87 , 35 , and 97% .
The following day , the patient &apos;s ABG was noted to be a pH of 7.32 , p02 50 , pCO2 43 , 82% on 100% high flow face masks .

LABORATORIES AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER TO THE MICU :
HOSPITAL COURSE :
MICU COURSE-The patient was continued on Bactrim at 15 mg / kg per day in divided doses for his PCP pneumonia .
The patient was switched from p.o. Prednisone to IV Solu-Medrol at equivalent therapeutic doses .
The patient &apos;s respiratory wheezes were treated symptomatically with bronchodilators .
The patient &apos;s anemia was treated with folate , iron , and vitamin B-12 .
The patient was noted to be agitated at times with acute oxygen desaturations at these times .
The patient &apos;s peak inspiratory pressures were noted to be elevated , consistent with an ARDS picture .
On <DATE>12/10/91</DATE> , the patient was noted to have an acutely diminished white count at 2.0 with a hematocrit of 32.0 .
Despite improvement in his chest x-ray noted on that day which was believed to be attributable to the steroids , the patient was switched to IV Pentamidine given the possibility of myelosuppression by Bactrim .
However , the patient was noted to become increasingly hypotensive with decreased urine output .
Despite this measure , the patient became increasingly hypotensive requiring the addition of Dopamine and Levophed drips .
At this time , his arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.07 , and the patient became aystolic .
Pentamidine 100 mg nebulized q.d. times three days , Pentamidine 300 mg IV q.d. , Solu-Medrol 20 mg IV t.i.d. , Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 , Morphine sulfate drip at 5 mg / hour IV , Dopamine drip 18 mcg / kg/min IV drip , Pavulon 2 mg IV q1hour , Levophef 16 mcg / min IV drip , ferrous sulfate 324 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , Folate 1 mg per NG tube q.d. , vitamin B-12 , Colace , vitamin K , senna .
