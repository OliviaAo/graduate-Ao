He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .
The patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .
He was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .
He therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation .
