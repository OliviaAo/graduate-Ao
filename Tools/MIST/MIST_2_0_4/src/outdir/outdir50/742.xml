She has had no chest pain .
Outside the hospital the patient is non-compliant with her diet running her sugars in the 200s despite NPH insulin .
On arrival to the nursing home she was fed an in-house diet which was markedly less coloric and sugar filled than her home diet .
Emergency Medical Service was called .

She was arousable to sternal rub only .
She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management .
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Severe degenerative joint disease of the spine and knees .
History of supraventricular tachycardia in <DATE>06/99</DATE> felt secondary to Desipramine toxicity .
Magnetic resonance imaging scan at that time notable only for chronic white matter changes .
Congestive heart failure .
Depression .
Hypothyroidism .
Glaucoma .
ALLERGIES :
Relafen which is contra-indicated because of ulcers .
Ultram .
Melphalan .
No alcohol use .
No drug use .
No tobacco use .
Pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accomodation .
Extra-ocular movements intact .
She was moving all four extremities .
Toes were down going bilaterally .
Vital signs :
temperature 95.1 F , heart rate 89 beats per minute in sinus rhythm .
Blood pressure 165/90 .
Pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accomodation .
Extra-ocular movements intact .
Jugular venous pressure 10 cm .

Heart regular rate and rhythm with a 1/6 systolic murmur with question of an opening snap .

Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrate and minimal linear atelectasis in the right mid lung zone .
Electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm with no changes compared with prior electrocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By system .
The patient &apos;s seizure was thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia in the setting of decreased oral intake on her standard anti-glycemic medications .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks in the past .
Her seizure was thought secondary to hypoglycemia and she had no further seizure activity in the hospital .
She did have some slightly paranoid behavior which her son says is typical .
The patient had an echocardiogram which revealed a normal ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities but mitral stenosis with peak gradient of 19 and mean gradient of 9 , dilated right ventricle , dilated right atrium , and right ventricle systolic pressure in the 60s .
After discussion with her primary care physician it was decided that she would have further cardiology assessment as an outpatient .
She was aggressively diuresed for her minimal congestive heart failure .
The patient had guaiac positive stools and had an elevated amylase without an elevated lipase .
These findings suggest some bowel pathology .
6. RENAL :
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was treated on Unasyn for concern of cellulitis .
