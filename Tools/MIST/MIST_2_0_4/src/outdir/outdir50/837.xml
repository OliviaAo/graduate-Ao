HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 81 year old woman with a history of hypertension , history of recurrent VPBs , admitted for investigation following a syncopal episode two weeks prior to admission .
The patient experienced a brief episode of loss of consciousness while driving her car two weeks prior to admission , at which time she collided with the car in front of her and rapidly regained consciousness .
There was no aura , no witnessed seizure activity and no post ictal symptoms .
After the syncopal episode the patient was evaluated at a local hospital with head and abdominal CT , EEG , and EKG , all of which were normal .
The patient has history of VPBs as noted above , treated with Flecainide with good symptomatic response .
Following discontinuation of this drug the patient noted return of palpitations .
Left mastectomy in 1982 for breast carcinoma .
DJD , hypertension , status post cholecystectomy , status post cataract surgery , status post herniorrhaphy .

SOCIAL HISTORY :

She is a nonsmoker , nondrinker .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :

Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout .
Hematocrit 44 , WBC count 4.9 thousand , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 thousand , potassium 3.6 , PT and PTT were within normal limits .
LFTs were normal .
It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient &apos;s episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress .
During the study , the right bundle branch was hit by the catheter , inducing a right bundle branch block .
Following this , upon rapid atrial pacing at a rate of 120 , there was revealed a bifascicular left block , which combined with the right bundle branch block caused a complete heart block .
The pacer was inserted on the fifth hospital day without event , and the patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day .
The patient is discharged home .
Followup with primary physician in one week .

ADMISSION DATE :
DISCHARGE DATE :
1. Obstructive jaundice .
3. biliary obstruction .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Therefore she was transferred to <HOSPITAL>Ph University Of Medical Center</HOSPITAL> and admitted there from <DATE>01/25</DATE> - <DATE>02/03</DATE> .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above ; appendectomy in 1916 , hysterectomy in 1941 , mastoid surgery in 1970 , shingles of right arm in 1994 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin daily .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is originally from <LOCATION>Tbalt</LOCATION> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
temperature 98.4 , blood pressure 116/60 , pulse 76 , respirations 18 .
HEENT :
The neck was supple with shotty lymphadenopathy , 2+ carotids without bruits .
Chest :
a few bibasilar crackles ; otherwise clear to auscultation .
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 94 , bicarbonate 31 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 218 , alkaline phosphatase 634 , LDH 212 , SGOT 30 , bilirubin 0.8 direct , total bilirubin 1.2 .
Sed rate 100 .
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
clear lungs .
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
The patient &apos;s subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .
Stable .
