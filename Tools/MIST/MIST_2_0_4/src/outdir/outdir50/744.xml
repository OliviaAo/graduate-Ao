Sepsis .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :

<PATIENT>Daie Elms</PATIENT> was a 50-year-old male , who underwent cadaveric renal transplant in 1992 , who presented with a three-week old scrape of the right popliteal fossa related to a prosthesis .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ; hypertension ; peripheral vascular disease ; coronary artery disease ; bilateral vitrectomies ; cadaveric renal transplant ; suprapubic tube for ureteral necrosis ; status post right below-knee amputation and left below-knee amputation ; asthma ; atrial fibrillation ; left arm arteriovenous fistula .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Minipress .
Digoxin .
Imuran .
Lasix .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination was remarkable for poor dentition .
The neck was supple without adenopathy .
The chest examination was remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally , with regular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and obese .
Mr. <PATIENT>Elms</PATIENT> was admitted to the hospital , and after multiple cultures were drawn , he was subsequently taken to the operating room on <DATE>8/21/96</DATE> for incision and drainage of a right thigh abscess .
His clinical condition continued to worsen with evidence of ongoing sepsis and renal failure , which transiently improved on hemodialysis , but generally progressively worsened .
On <DATE>9/3/96</DATE> , he underwent a transverse colostomy to allow diversion from the nonhealing leg and pelvis wounds .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
He was intubated at this time and could not be extubated thereafter .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
The family was notified , but declined a postmortem examination .
