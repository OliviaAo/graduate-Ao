 Mr.< PHI TYPE= '' PATIENT ''> **PHIName** < PHI > has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .
 He did well until he developed recurrent angina in < PHI TYPE= '' DATE ''> **PHIName** < PHI > of **PHIName** at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .
 Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to < PHI TYPE= '' HOSPITAL ''> **PHIName** & apos ; sdgot Medical Center < PHI > with recurrent chest pain .
 He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40 & apos ; s and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in < PHI TYPE= '' DATE ''> **PHIName** < PHI > of **PHIName** at 31 %.
 He was admitted to < PHI TYPE= '' HOSPITAL ''> **PHIName** & apos ; sdgot Medical Center < PHI > with a typical episode of this discomfort in < PHI TYPE= '' DATE ''> **PHIName** < PHI > of **PHIName** .
 Because of Mr.< PHI TYPE= '' PATIENT ''> **PHIName** < PHI >& apos ; s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and or impaired coronary flow reserve .
 He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on < PHI TYPE= '' DATE ''> **PHIName** **PHIDate** < PHI >, 1994 .
 There he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable **PHIName** pressures .
 Starting in the < PHI TYPE= '' DATE ''> **PHIName** < PHI > of **PHIName** , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .
 His medications that had been used individually or in combination **PHIName** beta blockers and **PHIName** **PHIName** , **PHIName** and coumadin , aspirin , **PHIName** and **PHIName** antagonists .
 HOSPITAL COURSE the primary concern upon Mr.< PHI TYPE= '' PATIENT ''> **PHIName** < PHI >& apos ; s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
 Coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from < PHI TYPE= '' DATE ''> **PHIName** < PHI > of **PHIName** .
 He was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr.< PHI TYPE= '' DOCTOR ''> Lato **PHIName** < PHI > of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
 Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous **PHIName** .
 This was utilized in making some changes in Mr.< PHI TYPE= '' PATIENT ''> **PHIName** < PHI >& apos ; s regiment .
 Repeat in vitro testing of Mr.< PHI TYPE= '' PATIENT ''> **PHIName** < PHI >& apos ; s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced **PHIName** spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .
 While in the hospital , Mr.< PHI TYPE= '' PATIENT ''> **PHIName** < PHI > continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .
 He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and **PHIName** and verapamil .
 Plasminogen was slightly high at **PHIName** with upper limit of normal being **PHIName** .
 Thrombin time and **PHIName** time were normal .
 Rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small **PHIName** coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work up was undertaken .
 He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of **PHIName** , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .
 Therefore , on < PHI TYPE= '' DATE ''> **PHIName** **PHIDate** < PHI >, the patient underwent left thorascopic **PHIName** sympathectomy by Dr.< PHI TYPE= '' DOCTOR ''> **PHIName** **PHIName** < PHI >.
