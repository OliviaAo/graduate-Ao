SPECIAL PROCEDURES :
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
WORK DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :
Permanent .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
He had a history of progressive gait ataxia since 1989 , worsening over the past few months , and a recent decline in memory and concentration .
Migraine headaches with visual changes , headache and photophobia had been present for many years .
Memory , gait and occasional urinary incontinence worsened after that time .
A computerized tomography scan done in the emergency room showed enlarged ventricles , suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pulse 72 and regular .
Blood pressure 154/90 .
There was no aphasia .
Gait was quite ataxic , with short steps , requiring support , but no freezing in place .
He swayed backward on the Romberg test .
Upward gaze was decreased .
Tendon reflex is absent .
No Hoffmann reflexes .
Coordination normal .
Pin prick sensation decreased below the ankles .
Routine laboratory studies were negative .
The computerized tomography scan showed the findings described above .
A therapeutic lumbar puncture was planned on the day after emergency admission , but his gait was noted to be considerably improved at that time , and the lumbar puncture was postponed until <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 5</PHI> , at which time 40 cc were removed .
There was slight further improvement of gait , mainly less unsteadiness , but no change in speed .
The gait was essentially what it had been before the episode of worsening prior to admission , moderate ataxia , slight flexed posture , very slight shuffling .
It was felt that this response and the presentation raised a definite question of symptomatic normal pressure hydrocephalus , but that this could not be diagnosed definitely at this time .

She underwent a Whipple procedure and a cholecystectomy .
Four months prior to admission , she had occasional band like chest pain across her entire chest .
Two weeks prior to admission , she had a presyncopal episode but did not lose consciousness .
There were no other symptoms .
One day prior to admission , she was seen at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dagreat Health</PHI> for 5-FU , her third cycle .
She complained of chest pain and back pain , and an EKG was obtained which showed new Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , and T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , consistent with an anterior septal myocardial infarction .
She was reviewed by the cardiologists and was admitted for further evaluation of her myocardial infarction .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Includes (1) pancreatic cancer , status post a Whipple procedure , on 5-FU .
Include 5-FU and Percocet for pain , Zantac , and Simethicone .
She has no known drug allergies .
She smoked up until ten years ago .
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is an elderly white female in no apparent distress with a temperature of 97.6 , blood pressure 122/70 , heart rate of 72 , and a respiratory rate of 20 .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , includes a white blood cell count of 5.6 , hematocrit 37.4 , platelets 312 .
Her electrolytes were within normal limits .
The CK was 89 .
The urinalysis showed 5-10 white blood cells .
There were two red blood cells .
The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 75 , axis -30 degrees , Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , new in comparison to <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 1985 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
However , her EKG &apos;s did progress to T-wave inversions in V1-V6 , and it was felt that the patient most likely had at some point had a myocardial infarction .
Her medicines could not be increased beyond low doses secondary to a low systolic blood pressure .
Just prior to discharge , she underwent an exercise tolerance test with a modified Bruce protocol where she went seven minutes and seventeen seconds , and stopped secondary to fatigue .
It was felt by the cardiologist on the case that this was more exercise than she usually did at home , and she was comfortable with the current medical regimen .
PROBLEM # 2 :
PANCREATIC CANCER .
Lumbosacral spines done during the admission did not show any change from x-rays done previously .
PROBLEM # 3 :
HISTORY OF DIZZINESS .
The patient complained of some dizziness and had a presyncopal episode prior to admission , however , the patient felt that her dizziness was unchanged from the dizziness that she had for several years .
ANEMIA .
The patient had an anemia on admission .
Reticulocyte count is pending at the time of this dictation .
I suspect that this is anemia of chronic disease , but could not rule out gastrointestinal blood loss , although she remained guaiac negative .
PROBLEM # 5 :
PYURIA .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
She should arrange to be followed up by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
Her diet is a low cholesterol diet .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION .
DIABETES ADULT ONSET .
HISTORY OF CARDIOVASUCLAR ACCIDENT .
GUAIAC POSITIVE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
He has no history of hypertension or family history .
In 1960 , the patient had an MI complicated by ventricular ectopic arrhythmia .
Since then , he has had rare angina over the past year , and has been able to walk his dog one mile a day with occasional mild left-sided chest pain that is always relived by a brief rest .
He also notes an induration caudication in his left calf .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/15</PHI>/90 , he had a parietal headache at 8:00 a.m. that was followed promptly by left-sided chest pain without diaphoresis , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , or palpitations which lasted for an hour with awaxing and waning course .
He went to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tlowepeh Hospital</PHI> Emergency Room , where his blood pressure was 120/80 , heart rate was 94 , respiratory rate was 32 , and he had a blood gas which was pO2 73 , pH 7.44 , pCO2 32 , and a chest x-ray that showed mild congestive heart failure .
His EKG showed an intraventricular conduction delay with anterolateral ST depressions and T waves inversions .
Chest pains were relieved with oxygen by nasal prong , two liters .
He was tansferred to the Coronary Care Unit where he was treated with IV nitroglycerin and Diltiazem .
Quinidine level on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/16</PHI> was 1.4 .
He had mild CHF , which was treated with Captopril and prn Lasix .
He had recurrent chest pains noted on both <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/17</PHI> three times , <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/19</PHI> one time , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/21</PHI> .
The episode on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/21</PHI> was noteworthy for shortness of breath and ST depression in V4-6 which required IV TNG , which was used briefly that night .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/22</PHI> , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Norri Hospital</PHI> for evaluation of his post MI angina .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
B12 IM , iron sulfate 324 mg t.i.d. , Diltiazem 60 q.i.d. , Diabeta 5 mg p.o.q.d. , Quinaglute 324 mg q. 12 hours , one baby aspirin b.i.d. , Halcion 0.25 mg p.o.q.h.s. , Nitrol Paste , Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d. , Slow-K two tablets p.o.q.d. , Captopril 0.25 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Zantac 115 mg p.o.b.i.d , and Carafate 1 gram p.o.b.i.d.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease complicated by myocardial infarction and ventricular ectopic arrhythmia in 1960 , also a left-sided CVA in 1960 , adult onset diabetes , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation of unknown duration , anemia which was consistent with iron deficiency , a left retinal hemorrhage status post laser treatment last year .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature of 97 degrees with a rate of 90 in atrial fibrillation and blood pressure 110/82 .
Heart examination showed a PMI , which was diffuse and inferiorly displaced with an auricular rhythm with an S1 and S2 , II/VI systolic ejection murmur , no rub or gallop was noted .
Pulses :
2+ femoral without bruit , 1+ dorsalis pedis on the left , trace dorsalis pedis on the right and trace posterior tibial bilaterally .
Hemoglobin was 10.7 white cell count was 8.2 , platelets 211 , PT and PTT were 13.4/37.6 , Quinidine was 2.5 , and CKA was 53 .
Repeat ABG done later had a pH of 7.38 p02 of 247 , O2 saturation of 99.9% , pC02 22 , total C02 of 14 .
The patient was admitted to the unit and experienced some nausea and vomiting with minimal EKG changes .
He became tachycardic to the rate of 110 , with a blood pressure of 128 to 130 .
His heart rate went down to 60 .
At this time , he was also given 25 mg po of Lopressor .
He complained of continued nausea and vomiting .
He was given Compazine PR and was started on Dopamine and then Dobutamine was added when that did not appear sufficient to increase his blood pressure above 80 .
He had a good urinary output .
His systolic blood pressure was then in the 100 to 110 range and at that time his IV fluids were decreased .
However , acutely at around 8:00 p.m. the systolic blood pressure plummeted down to 60 to 70 and at this time a chest x-ray was done which showed moderate CHF .
On the above chest x-ray no evidence of dissection was noted .
Even with the increase in the pressors , heart rate dropped into the 50s .
Oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .
The patient was intubated and prior to intubation his rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .
He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .
Atropine one amp was given .
There was a question of fleeting T waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead EKG .
At this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .
At this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .
The rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.
The patient was without respirations or blood pressure .
The family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
congestive heart failure .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
He had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .
Despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .
Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .
The venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .
There was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .
The liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .
His chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .
The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , 1992 .
Later , an echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .
The aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .
The left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .
There was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .
A Persantine Thallium scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .
potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .
This was of uncertain significance .
The hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .
Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .
Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 .
There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .
Left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .
There was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .
The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .
A dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .
A large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .
The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
The saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .
These findings were reviewed with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Patella</PHI> and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> &apos;s management .
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .
He is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .
We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wierst</PHI> and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .

DISCHARGE DATE :
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
At baseline , he had lived with his guardians , <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Pandeprob</PHI> , he was &quot; slow &quot; , walked with a very ataxic gait , did not talk much and spends most of his time watching TV and smoking .
A recent head computerized tomography scan in <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>/92 was negative .
He had been evaluated by his local medical doctor for his weight loss .
He was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> after being found in the bathroom , on the floor at 8 a.m. , unresponsive .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
He had not had any recurrence .
He had history of alcohol abuse in the past .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
A generally cachectic white male , resting quietly with his eyes closed .
His blood pressure was 140/70 , heart rate 75 .
His oropharynx was clear .
His skin was clear .
The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 , regular rate and rhythm , no murmur , rub or gallop .
Extremities - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The discs were flat .
There was no retinopathy .
He had a gag and good palpate movement .
There was a right facial droop which was mild .
He lifted his left leg off the bed , but no against resistance .
He had clonus bilaterally with up going toe on the right , but not the left .
LABORATORY DATA :
An erythrocyte sedimentation rate 3 , hematocrit 44 , white blood count 21.7 , lytes within normal limits .
The head computerized tomography scan without contrast showed a 3 x 3 x 5 cm. hemorrhage extending form the left Sylvian fissure and put amen to the left front oparietal lobe .
There was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was a large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .
His blood pressure was not elevated .
The aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and B12 .
An magnetic resonance imaging study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/17</PHI>/92 showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .
The medial region of the hematoma was felt to be suspicious for tumor versus arteriovenous malformation .
There was no enhancement seen in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .
A cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for mass effect from the hematoma .
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and G-tube was performed at the same time .
There was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .
This confirmed an 8 mm. mass which was bright on T2 and homogeneous in the right lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with a benign hemangioma or cyst .
The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .
Initially , the patient remained drowsy until Decadron was added to his medical regimen .
He awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the right side and ability to walk with assistance .
He was started on Dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .
This seemed to help him remarkably with increased activity .
His Decadron has been tapered slowly to zero and his examination on discharge was as follows :
He still spends a lot of time in bed , although easily arousable .
He sleeps with a hypophonia , but occasionally will speak louder when he is in better spirits .
His pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .
There was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .
He had limited vertical up gaze .
He still had a significant right central facial droop .
His gag was intact with palatal movements .
On repetitive testing with Speech Therapy had not been able to swallow in a safe manner .
Thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .
He had approximately 4+ to 5/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities .
HE had an upgoing toe .
On the left , his reflexes wee 2-2+ with a downgoing toe .
He had right clonus , which was sustained .
At that time , there was no evidence of a mass behind the hematoma .
It was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .
Depending upon his head computerized tomography scan , he will proceed to a brain biopsy if needed .

At the family &apos;s request , the patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .
She was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .
The patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .
She was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .
Because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .
Her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .
Towards the end of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .
A rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/13</PHI> , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .
She was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .
After considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .
She , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .
It was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .
In the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .
The sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .
She was returned to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/22</PHI> and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .
Her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .
She subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .
She remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
LABORATORY DATA :
HOSPITAL COURSE :
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/24</PHI>/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/26</PHI>/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/01</PHI>/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
The patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/02</PHI>/00 .

Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Rule</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 26</PHI> at 1 PM had the acute onset of dizziness , headache , right arm and leg weakness as he was getting to stand up from watching TV .
He went to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ton University Hospital</PHI> where a head CT was performed that showed no evidence of bleed .
Initial blood pressure on presentation was recorded at 83/47 .
He was treated with aspirin .
MRI was performed that revealed an acute stroke in the left ACA distribution .
MRA revealed question of significant left internal carotid stenosis just proximal to the cavernous portion of the carotid .
For this lesion and question of possible intervention the patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tonwalkma Hospital</PHI> .
His right upper extremity was found to be 5 - out of 5 .
The patient was ambulating with a walker .

Of note the patient had not been on aspirin prior to his admission at the outside hospital .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient quit tobacco 45 years ago .
His heart was irregularly irregular with a III out of VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border .
However several hours later in the morning he was 3 out of 5 of the iliopsoas , quads and hamstrings .
0 out of 5 more distally .
Sensory exam was intact to all modalities in the upper extremities .
He had decreased vibration in the lower extremities bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was started on heparin for concern of embolic ACA stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation or possibly artery to artery embolus given his left carotid stenosis .
He was seen by Interventional NeuroRadiology who recommended a CTA to better visualize question of left ICA stenosis .
However it did show contrast throughout .
It was thought by NeuroRadiology that this lesion given its proximity to the petrous portion in bone would not be amenable to stenting .
Given the embolic appearance of the stroke the patient was changed from heparin to Plavix and aspirin for anticoagulation .
He was not placed on Coumadin given discussion with his primary care doctor and history of multiple GI bleeds on aspirin alone .
He was started on Nexium in addition to Zantac for further GI prophylaxis .
on CTA pt. was noted to have incidental mass of left thyroid gland .
Recommended to have a thyroid fine needle biopsy for further evaluation .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Chiybelb</PHI> will be notified of this finding for follow up .

She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;

none
Patient is an 80 year old female with a history of dementia , and of a choreoathetotic movement disorder of unclear etiology .
W / U for Huntington &apos;s , ceruloplasmin , TSH , etc have all been negative in the past .
Patient was admitted to neurology service .
The major therapeutic change during the hospitalization was the starting of zyprexa to see if as part of its side-effect profile it would decrease the choreoathetotic movement symptoms .
She still has significant myoclonic component in her arms especially with volition , but this med will certainly be continued .
While essentially what we ARE hoping for in this use of the med is extra-pyramidal side effects , she should be monitored for any excessive or debilitating parkinsonian symptoms such as excessive rigidity .

Initial work up was unrevealing .
She was diagnosis with a urinary tract infection and perineal inflammation and was transferred to the hospital and treated with IV Tequin for urinary tract infection .
Throughout her admission , she experienced occasional low-grade temperatures to 99 Fahrenheit with persistent leukocytosis .
There was a reported examination of her peritoneal fluid when fluid was being drawn for culture .
A catheter was subsequently placed for treatment of __________ for three days of ceftazidime .
She was switched , however , to hemodialysis from peritoneal dialysis .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for end-stage renal disease secondary to chronic urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis with vesicoureteral reflux .
And status post right nephrectomy , status post cholecystectomy , ____________thyroidectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">BRI HEALTH</PHI> FROM <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">APER HOSPITAL</PHI> :
Aspirin 81 mg qd , Epogen 10,000 units tiw , folate 4 mg qd , K-Dur 20 mEq , magnesium oxide 400 mg po qd , Phenergan 12.5 mg q4h prn , Prinivil 5 mg qd , Renagel 20 mg po qd , vitamin E 400 IU bid , pamidronate 30 mg IV q3months .
Include SULFA , CODEINE , TETRACYCLINE , NITROFURANTOIN .
Not available at the time .
She denies the use of tobacco or ethanol .
She was raised in the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</PHI> and spent many years on an organic farm .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
The patient was afebrile at 98.7 , blood pressure 128/64 , heart rate 96 , respiratory rate 22 , 02 s 96% on room air .
The pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation .
The oropharynx was moist .
The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm .
There was no palpable lymphadenopathy .
The heart had a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no hepatosplenomegaly .
There was no erythema around the catheter site .
On neurologic examination , the patient followed only simple commands .
She missed her nose with both hands when asked to touch her nose .
There was a questionable positive Babinski on the right side .
The toes were downgoing on the left .
She answered appropriately to yes-no questions , but _____________
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 .
Her liver function tests were all within normal limits .
Her coagulation factors showed a PT of 13.2 , INR 1.2 , PTT 23.2 .
Her white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 .
The hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 .
The differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes .
The electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .
Head CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/30</PHI>/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe .
The patient &apos;s presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer &apos;s of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .
Work up included from a neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .
In concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .
For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .
For prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .
However , these antibodies were both within normal limits .
The patient &apos;s mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/10</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/12</PHI> and was markedly improved on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/13</PHI>/2002 , compared with the day of admission .
However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .
The nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .
On the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .
We entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .
We will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .
Pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Termarimed</PHI> pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .

Admission Date :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">03/11</PHI>/1995
Report Status :
Date :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">03/24</PHI>/1995
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions .
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .
In the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with Procainamide .
His primary event complaints are episodes of shortness of breath with neck pain without radiation but with dizziness , light-headedness , pallor , and some chest pressure .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He also complains of 30-yard dyspnea on exertion and one-block claudication .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Carbon</PHI> , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
His Procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on Amiodarone .
However , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .
The night before admission , his blood pressure was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 .
He was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .
Hypertension .
Urosepsis in 1982 .
A 65% stenosis of his proximal right internal carotid artery in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/92 .
Cataract surgery in his righteye .
A 2.5-cm. abdominal aortic aneurysm which was recently sizedat 3.5 cm .
ALLERGIES :
Shellfish , which causes nausea and vomiting .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Smoker for greater than 100 pack years ( 3-1/2 packs per day x 35 years ) .
No ethanol history .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative for diabetes , hypertension , or coronary artery disease .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was afebrile .
Extraocular movements were intact .
He had a furrowed tongue , but hisoropharynx was otherwise negative .
His JVP was difficult to assess with a questionable meniscus near the ear at 45 degrees .
The PMI was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .
Heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .
An S2 split was not appreciated .
There were no murmurs .
There was no apparent S3 .
Chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .
Extremities were warm with good distal pulses .
Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were normal .
Digoxin level was 1.3 .
The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
A right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 .
His left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to OM was not detected by the aortic root shot .
The ejection fraction was not calculated .
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no EKG changes during these episodes .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/22</PHI> , after an appropriate load of Amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .
There were no complications from this procedure , and he remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of discharge .
He was reloaded back upon Coumadin and reached a therapeutic INR .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Amiodarone 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for the first two weeks , decreasing to 200 mg. p.o. q.d. in the subsequent time .

2. Pulmonary congestion .
3. Status post mitral valve replacement , with a porcine valve , and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/28</PHI>/76 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Melvean Ace</PHI> .
In 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Times</PHI> , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .
She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .
She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .
A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .
Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .
This was on diltiazem and digoxin .
At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .
Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .
She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .
Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/4</PHI> , and diltiazem was restarted .
A cardiac catheterization was carried out on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/5</PHI> , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .
It showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .
The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .
There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .
The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .
With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .
This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
She tolerated the procedure well .
We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .
If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Avejoh Wierst</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Em Neighburce</PHI> .

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES :
Chest x-ray <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 :
The patient also had a shoulder film done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .
A lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
Two major fracture fragments were seen at the humeral head , articulating with the glenoid fossa .
Innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal humeral shaft .
The glenoid fossa was intact .
normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , Q - waves seen in II , III , and AVF with probable old inferior myocardial infarction .
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17</PHI>/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/12</PHI>/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Columbus Day</PHI> which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19</PHI>/97 , and all muscular in origin .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/15</PHI>/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fordwoodall Stick</PHI> , in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156</PHI> .
The patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848</PHI> through his primary-care physician .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/23</PHI>/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/22</PHI>/97 was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/97 to 25/1.9 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/23</PHI>/97 .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/15</PHI>/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .
Repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .
The patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .
Stable , good .

Sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .
( On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/06</PHI> , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .
His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/13</PHI>/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/16</PHI>/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/15</PHI>/91 .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/18</PHI>/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.
An autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .

DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Colace 100 mg PO t.i.d. , Tropine 1 percent OD GTT q.day , Neurontin 100 mg PO b.i.d. , heparin 5,000 units sub Q b.i.d. , Prednisone 5 mg PO q.day , Isordil 30 mg PO t.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg PO q.day , Plavix 75 mg PO q.day , Zestril 10 mg PO q.day , Lasix 20 mg PO q.day .
The patient is disabled .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotereef</PHI> is a <PHI TYPE="AGE">93-year-old</PHI> woman who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daleglo Medical Center</PHI> with renal insufficiency .
The patient was in her usual state of health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/10</PHI>/98 when she was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daleglo Medical Center</PHI> with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes .
She was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days .
The patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
She was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated .
She was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated BUN and creatinine and failure to eat .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .
She has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .
The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
She also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .
On arrival to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .
However , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .
On physical examination her pulse was 55 .
Her systolic blood pressure was 110 .
Her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .
Laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .
BUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .
A chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .
A urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .
The patient had been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
At that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .
She was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .
However , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .
A cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
Multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .
There was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .
The patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .
Her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .
Her BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .
The patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .
However , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .
Initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .
I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .
The patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .
Nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .
The patient will be transferred tomorrow to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Naplesvillechaelty</PHI> .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 75 year old female with a history of psychotic depression with paranoia who presents status post a few days of incontinence , increased confusion , and collapse .
The patient who has a baseline mental status / psychiatric impairment was reported to be increasingly confused and paranoid over the past few days .
She was reportedly incontinent of urine and diaphoretic .
She was brought to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Ward by ambulance , where she was found to be confused , oriented to self and family only , and with dry mucous membranes .
She does have paranoid features .
The patient has a history of near syncope in 1988 and also a history of dehydration .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As outlined above .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with elderly siblings .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Mother with depression .
Elderly obese woman lying comfortably in bed in no acute distress .
The vital signs revealed blood pressure 150/83 , heart rate 84 , respirations 20 per minute and temperature 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm with normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
revealed one plus edema bilaterally .
The neurological examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented only to self .
She is not cooperative with the full neurological examination but she did move all four extremities .
LABORATORY DATA :
The amylase was 37 .
The complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 11,900 ; hematocrit of 38 and platelet count of 207,000 ; the tox screen was negative .
The prothrombin time was 10.1 and partial thromboplastin time 28.5 .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with axis of 0 degrees and normal intervals .
There were no ST-T wave changes .
Head computerized tomography scan revealed diffuse cortical atrophy , increased ventricles and no acute bleed .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
The patient was mildly dehydrated at time of admission and was replaced with intravenous fluids until she began taking good PO intake .
By the end of her hospitalization she was eating well on her own .
Admission urinalysis revealed 5-10 red blood cells , 10-20 white blood cells and few bacteria .
Therefore the patient was started on Bactrim for urinary tract infection .
She did not tolerate oral medication initially and was switched to intravenous ampicillin .
The antibiotics were discontinued after three days of intravenous antibiotic therapy .
A repeat urinalysis done later in the course of the hospitalization revealed no white blood cells .
Conclusion was that this was a dementing process .
The testing was performed by a staff neuropsychologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lornsook Trusmoag</PHI> , PhD , telephone number <PHI TYPE="PHONE">959-1490</PHI> .
She stated that she would be happy to reevaluate Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fleetheesc</PHI> in the future if necessary .
Plain films revealed soft tissue swelling , neck and face computerized tomography scan revealed a nonspecific enlarged right parotid gland with increased attenuation consistent with an inflammatory or neoplastic process .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so a contrast study was not available .
They recommended that a cytology sample be obtained and sent and that the patient be treated with a 14 day course of Keflex .
Cytology consult was called , but by the time the cytologist came to do a fine needle aspiration the mass had shrunken to the point where there was nothing to aspirate .
The ENT physician who saw the patient is Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freieslowkays</PHI> .
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freieslowkays</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 8</PHI> , 1994 at 1:20 p.m. at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital</PHI> .
The phone number is <PHI TYPE="PHONE">610-7597</PHI> .
However , she has been reluctant to even move from the bed to the chair since admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
Physical Therapy has been working with her .
Fear of falling seems to be a large component of this , and the patient will likely need considerable patience in convincing her it is okay to get out of bed again .

ALLERGIES :
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Negative except for increasing fatigue in the past two weeks and leg cramps at night .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a blood pressure of 158/88 .
Temperature 97.4 .
Physical examination was significant for ulcerated fungating lesions on his left ear , dorsum of his hands .
There was a right carotid bruit .
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2 , S4 without murmurs .
Spleen was felt 4 cm below the costal margin .
Pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally .
Neurological exam was nonfocal .
On admission included a white blood cell count of 77.8 with 82% lymphs .
Hematocrit 35.2 .
Platelet count 104,000 .
Potassium 4.4 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , normal axis and intervals , no changes from previous EKG , no signs of ischemia or infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/2</PHI>/92 which showed the following :
Pressures RA 9/4 , RV 24/7 , PA 24/12 with a mean of 14 , PCW 12/9 with a mean of 10 .
Cardiac output 6.7 .
Cardiac index 3.2 .
There was also 50% occlusion of the left proximal circumflex , 95% occlusion of the right proximal coronary artery , 50% occlusion of the OMB1 , 90% occlusion of the mid LAD .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The patient then underwent PTCA of the distal RCA lesion .
Because of difficulty passing the wire through the graft to the RCA , the proximal 95% RCA lesion was dilated first and then the distal RCA lesion was dilated .
The patient did not experience any chest pain during the procedure and has not had any chest pain since the procedure .
The sheaths were removed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/4</PHI>/92 and heparin was restarted four hours after sheath removal and maintained for two days because of a possible small dissection in the RCA .
Repeat hematocrit showed it to be stable at 27 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/5</PHI> .
It was thought that the drop in hematocrit was secondary to his chemotherapy , some small dilutional effect and small blood loss from the PTCA , although there was no evidence of significant bleeding .
The patient was asymptomatic except for some back pain from lying flat after the catheterization procedures .
His vital signs remained stable .

The right superior parathyroid gland was found to be markedly enlarged and consistent with an adenoma .
Postoperatively , the patient did well and was able to cough and phonate completely with no changes from preoperative .
The plan was to start her on heparin and Coumadin and discontinue her heparin when her Coumadin levels became therapeutic as judged by the prothrombin time / INR .
However , on postoperative day number two , the patient in the afternoon noticed some tingling in her hands and also some tingling hear her perioral region .
She had no muscular weakness noted .
An ionized calcium was drawn which was low at 1.0 .
As a result , the patient was started on Os-Cal 250 mg PO q.i.d. On postoperative day number three , her ionized calcium was 1.06 and her Os-Cal was increased to 500 q.i.d.
However , her ionized calcium decreased to 0.97 and she was given one amp of calcium gluconate .
On postoperative day number five , the patient felt fine and had an INR of 1.9 with a prothrombin time of 16.6 .
She had had no further episodes of tingling in her fingers after the initial episode which had prompted us originally to draw the ionized calcium .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
2. Lopid 600 mg PO b.i.d. ,
4. Os-Cal 500 mg PO q.i.d. ,

She was staged as lB and pathology showed a small cell neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix .
She underwent a radical hysterectomy .
in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> of l990 , she had a vaginal apex mass on examination .
Cystoscopy and proctoscopy were negative .
A CT , however , confirmed a large pelvic mass with bilateral hydronephrosis .
Between <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of l990 , she received two cycles of chemotherapy in two parts alternating Cisplatin and VP-l6 with Vincristine , Cytoxan , and Adriamycin .
Her chemotherapy was then changed to a single agent of Cytoxan .
Also in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of l99l , she had right hip pain .
There was a bony metastasis .
Orthopedic Surgeons did an open reduction and internal fixation of a lytic lesion involving the right femur .
She had prolonged neutropenia and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 28</PHI> , she was admitted with a headache .
CT scan at that time was normal .
She had non-focal findings per the Neurology Service .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 6</PHI> , she began the next cycle of second line chemotherapy consisting of Carboplatin , Ifosfamide , and Mesna .
Since the last cycle of chemotherapy , she has had continued right hip pain and right mid lateral abdominal discomfort .
She presents for a bone scan , blood transfusion , and consideration of her third cycle of second line chemotherapy .
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Radical hysterectomy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of l989 , open reduction and internal fixation of femur in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of l99l , and examination under anesthesia , cystoscopy , and proctoscopy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> of l990 .
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY :
Zovirax 200 mg five times daily , Methadone 50 mg t.i.d. , and Ativan p.r.n.

There were no peritoneal signs and no guarding .
EXTREMITIES :
Without edema .
PELVIC :
Her hematocrit was 22.9 and platelets were l24 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The bone scan was performed which revealed multiple metastases to the spine , ribs , and skull .
There was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur .
Plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .
The Radiation Service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .
She was also seen by the Dermatology Service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis .
The patient also received a unit of donor direct blood .
However , they felt that at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Venbonlea Health</PHI> , there were several possible options including a possible phase I trial regimen .

9) STATUS POST ILEUS SECONDARY TO GENERAL ANESTHESIA FOR TOOTH EXTRACTION ON THIS ADMISSION .
10) STATUS POST TOOTH EXTRACTION .
11) HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a long history of alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease as well as seizure disorder related to alcohol withdrawal and multiple <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> admissions for detox and multiple detox facilities in the past .
The patient also recently ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">06</PHI>/93 ) was diagnosed with infiltrating cancer of the hypopharynx and was scheduled to undergo XRT but had not yet started .
Recently the patient noticed hoarseness secondary to vocal cord involvement of the tumor .
On the day of admission the patient was in a detox center undergoing detox prior to beginning his XRT and was in his usual state of health at that time when he had the acute onset of coughing after swallowing some chicken a la king .
The patient also was noted to have secretions draining from his mouth .
He was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Stamgibonnole Hospital</PHI> for further evaluation .
Despite multiple attempts at extraction at that point they were unable to extract the foreign body and it was felt that the patient should be admitted and attempt extraction later in the afternoon .
1) Alcohol abuse complicated by hepatitis , cirrhosis , seizure disorder , encephalopathy .
3) Hypertension .
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , shellfish , Doxycycline , also the patient had rash with Ceclor .
MEDICATIONS :
On transfer included Dilantin 100 mg po t.i.d. , Ceclor , Motrin , Percocet p.r.n.
Neck exam no JVD or lymphadenopathy .
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Extremities with trace pedal edema , 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses .
Dilantin level 13.7 .
SMA 7 was unremarkable aside from a glucose of 173 and a potassium of 3.1 .
UA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .
Extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .
EGD was performed .
Subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .
There was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .
The patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/22</PHI>/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .
The patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .
Other GI issues include the patient &apos;s hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .
2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .
Because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .
3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .
A swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .
Several NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .
The patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .
The family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient &apos;s nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .
It is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .
The patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/22</PHI>/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .
The chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .
No organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .
It was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .
He had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .
7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .
It was decided the patient &apos;s code status would not be DNR , DNI .
8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .
He underwent extraction of all his teeth on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21</PHI>/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a GI bleed .
Laboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .
The white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .
The last PT and PTT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/26</PHI>/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/27</PHI>/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .
A faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .
Extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21</PHI>/93 .
COMPLICATIONS :
1) Aspiration pneumonia .
2) GI bleed .
3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .

Hypoglycemic seizure .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Pa</PHI> is a 67 year old woman with a history notable for congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , transient ischemic attacks and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
Over the few months prior to admission the patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion and increasing weight gain to the tune of approximately 30 lbs despite increasing diuresis by her primary care physician .
An echocardiogram at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> in 1997 revealed a normal ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormality .
By her primary care physicians report an echocardiogram at an outside hospital in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 1999 revealed mild left atrial enlargement and mild right ventricular dilatation .
The primary care physician also reports an increasing new mitral regurgitation murmur over the past several weeks .
She has had no chest pain .
Three days prior to admission , secondary to increasing difficulty with ambulation and dyspnea on exertion the patient was admitted to a nursing home .
Outside the hospital the patient is non-compliant with her diet running her sugars in the 200s despite NPH insulin .
On arrival to the nursing home she was fed an in-house diet which was markedly less coloric and sugar filled than her home diet .
Early on the morning of admission the patient was found down , diaphoretic and responsive only to sternal rub .
She had a witnessed seizure-like episode .
Her blood sugar was 48 .
Emergency Medical Service was called .
The patient was intubated , given thiamine and D50 as well as intravenous Lasix and she was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room .
She was arousable to sternal rub only .
She had minimal crackles bilaterally and had an unremarkable electrocardiogram .
Her chest x-ray showed only mild failure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy , nephropathy and retinopathy status post laser treatment .
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation given a history of gastrointestinal bleed .
Upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
Hypercholesterolemia status post multiple transient ischemic attacks in the past , status post a right hemiparesis which has now resolved on aspirin .
Mild chronic dementia .
History of supraventricular tachycardia in <PHI TYPE="DATE">06</PHI>/99 felt secondary to Desipramine toxicity .
Magnetic resonance imaging scan at that time notable only for chronic white matter changes .
Congestive heart failure .
Depression .
Fibromyalgia .
Glaucoma .
Melphalan .
Bactrim .
Desipramine which causes supraventricular tachycardia .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
No alcohol use .
No drug use .
No tobacco use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was arousable to voice .
Pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accomodation .
Extra-ocular movements intact .
She was moving all four extremities .
Toes were down going bilaterally .
Vital signs :
Blood pressure 165/90 .
Pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accomodation .
Extra-ocular movements intact .
Neck supple and non-tender without thyromegaly or nodules .
2+ carotid pulses without bruits .
A diastolic murmur was noted by one listener .
Abdomen had mild right upper quadrant tenderness with positive bowel sounds .
Rectal was guaiac positive .
Right heel ulcer with eschar .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Amylase 473 , lipase 6.8 , white blood cell count 7.4 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets 222 .
Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrate and minimal linear atelectasis in the right mid lung zone .
Electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm with no changes compared with prior electrocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By system .
1. ENDOCRINE :
The patient &apos;s seizure was thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia in the setting of decreased oral intake on her standard anti-glycemic medications .
The patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks in the past .
She did have some slightly paranoid behavior which her son says is typical .
She was continued on her Trazodone , Neurontin and Zyprexa .
She was aggressively diuresed and her shortness of breath somewhat improved as did her pedal edema .
4. PULMONARY :
She was aggressively diuresed for her minimal congestive heart failure .
These findings suggest some bowel pathology .
The patient is known to have had an upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of Coumadin .
An outpatient gastrointestinal workup may be indicated .
6. RENAL :
The patient &apos;s lower extremities were bilaterally erythematous consistent with chronic venous stasis .
However she did have a low grade temperature to 100F and it was thought that given her diabetes and ulcer on her heel she should be covered for possible cellulitis .

ADMISSION DATE :
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">12/03</PHI>/96
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">8/21</PHI>/96 , incision and drainage of right thigh .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">9/3</PHI>/96 , transverse colostomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The wound became progressively indurated with drainage , and he presented for evaluation and treatment .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Prednisone .
Procardia .
Minipress .
Imuran .
Lasix .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an obese man in no acute distress .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and obese .
The genitourinary examination was notable for a suprapubic tube in place with normal male genitalia and guaiac negative stools on rectal examination .
Extremity examination revealed bilateral below-knee amputations with a 2 x 4 centimeter area of inflammation in the right popliteal fossa with a draining sinus .
Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
At the time of admission , BUN and creatinine were 89 and 4.4 ; white blood count 19.3 ; hematocrit 21.9 ; PT 15.1 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
There appeared to be a component of necrotizing fasciitis to this , and he was taken back to the operating room the next day for incision and drainage of a pelvic abscess and intraabdominal abscess .
His clinical condition continued to worsen with evidence of ongoing sepsis and renal failure , which transiently improved on hemodialysis , but generally progressively worsened .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/3</PHI>/96 , he underwent a transverse colostomy to allow diversion from the nonhealing leg and pelvis wounds .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
His nutrition remained poor throughout this time in spite of numerous attempts at enteral alimentation .
He was intubated at this time and could not be extubated thereafter .
He became increasingly more unresponsive and remained quite septic and febrile , resistant to aggressive antibiotic treatment .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
Over the next two days , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Elms</PHI> was kept comfortable and given intravenous fluids and tube feeds , but he remained extremely ill .
He continued to deteriorate until <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/96 , at which time he became bradycardic and asystolic .
He had no spontaneous cardiac or neurologic activity at this time , and he was declared dead at 12:15 A.M. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/96 .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was a 56 year old white male who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> for rule out pancreatic pseudocyst .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> had a past medical history which included Wegener &apos;s granulomatosis , history of an anterior myocardial infarction , and gallstone pancreatitis .
He was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> with severe recurrent pancreatitis , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain .
His amylase on admission there was 1,961 .
The patient had two recent admissions for pancreatitis in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1994 , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> 1994 .
His amylase decreased to 51 , and the increased back to 151 on hospital day #10 .
At that time , he spiked a temperature to 103 .
He also became increasingly confused .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. As above .
Ejection fraction was felt to be 35% in 1993 .
Recent echocardiogram suggests ejection fraction of 15% .
3. Wegener &apos;s granulomatosis , with associated chronic renal insufficiency .
2. Pepcid , 20 mg. , intravenously , q12h.
3. Digoxin , 0.125 mg. , intravenously , qD .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Temperature was 102 , heart rate was 110 , respiratory rate was 22 , blood pressure was 113/63 .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat was benign .
Lungs :
Rales at the right base , bilateral decreased breath sounds at the bases .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count was 14.4 , hematocrit was 36.2 , platelet count was 217 , sodium was 135 , potassium was 3.3 , chloride was 99 , bicarbonate was 25 , BUN was 40 , creatinine was 1.9 , glucose was 124 , urinalysis was negative , PT was 12.2 , PTT was 24.5 , calcium was 7.8 , phosphorus was 3.7 , albumin was 2.3 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , alkaline phosphatase was 202 , SGPT was 32 , SGOT was 64 , LDH was 998 , amylase was 150 .
Evidence of old left anterior septal infarct .
Chest X-ray :
Large left ventricle , bilateral atelectasis or effusion .
IN SUMMARY , the patient was considered to have severe necrotizing pancreatitis , with severe cardiac disease .
The patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/17</PHI>/95 , GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/28</PHI>/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
Because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/28</PHI>/95 .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .
Thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/15</PHI>/95 .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
3. Isordil , 10 mg. , po , t.i.d.
4. Nitropaste , 1 inch to chest wall , q8h.
5. Carafate , one gram , po or per nasogastric tube , q.i.d. , Cardizem , 30 mg. , po , q6h , digoxin , 0.25 mg. , po or intravenously , qD , fluconazole , 200 mg. , qD , for five more days , after transfer , for a total of a 14 day course , total parenteral nutrition to meet the patient &apos;s nutritional needs .
The patient has an ostomy appliance around the former site of his pancreatic fistula drain .
This area has continued to drain and it is felt that it could be best managed by an ostomy appliance and stoma care .

DEATH
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient noted onset of diffuse abdominal pain , periumbilical and epigastric in nature , nausea and vomiting and back pain starting at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission , <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/00 .
The patient denies fevers , chills or sweats , shortness of breath or chest pain .
He had a normal bowel movement the day prior to admission .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Splenectomy , total gastrectomy as above , for gastric lymphoma for which he also received chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Epogen and Vitamin B 12 injections .
No known drug allergies .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
White blood cell count 4.5 , hematocrit 31.9 , creatinine 1.1 .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , nontender .
No hernias .
The patient did have right costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted after placement of a nasogastric tube and was brought emergently to the operating room after a CT scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .
There was no evidence of perforation on the CT scan .
Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .
The patient was invasively lined with a Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .
At this point the patient &apos;s creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for the prospect of sepsis given his neutropenia and previous splenectomy and then an echocardiogram was performed to assess left ventricular function .
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/14</PHI>/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .
However prior to this it was also noted that the patient &apos;s scrotum was necrotic .
In the abdomen the patient &apos;s retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled-off .
The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .
Upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic-like picture and was maintained on Neo-Synephrine .
He was hydrated vigorously .
It should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have a pancreatitis by enzymes .
This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .
The patient &apos;s urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .
The patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .
The patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16</PHI>/00 the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Repeated pleurocentesis .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
He was admitted to the Medical Service where he was found to have a transudative , right-sided effusion thought again to be the equivalent of his ascites on the basis of end-stage liver disease .
It was tapped and drained with placement of a chest tube .
The chest tube was removed , but then replaced on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">14th of February</PHI> , and maintained a continuous and large volume output .
This change in mental status remained refractory to medical management , and in the setting of recurrent spiking fevers and worsening renal function , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">17th of February</PHI> , 1997 .
In the Intensive Care Unit , his chest tube continued to have massive volume output , and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid .
Early in his Intensive Care Unit admission , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Hibbslires</PHI> was intubated and ventilated , placed on broad antibiotic coverage including Vancomycin , Fluconazole , Ceftazidime , and Flagyl .
His renal function continued to worsen and he developed hypervolemic hyponatremia , and hemodynamic parameters consistent with sepsis .
Blood cultures in this setting grew out Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic coverage was altered to cover this organism appropriately .
During the first week of <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> in spite of antibiosis , the patient developed worsening renal failure , became anuric , and developed rapid progression in spite of his chest tube of the right-sided hydrothorax in addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome vs. extreme volume overload .
He became dependent on pressers .
In consultation with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leynslentnerswaimjesc</PHI> and with his gastrointestinal physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Loydbreunlinke</PHI> , and with the patient &apos;s family , the decision was made in the setting of his grim prognosis and multiple morbidities that further aggressive treatment would not be pursued .
The patient was evaluated for continuous venous venous hemodialysis , which in the end in the setting of the family &apos;s wishes , was not begun with this patient .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th of February</PHI> , the patient succumbed to overwhelming sepsis and anuric renal failure , and hypervolemia .
The time of death was 5:16 A.M. on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th of February</PHI> , 1997 .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leynslentnerswaimjesc , Lau</PHI> , and <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Launtburce</PHI> were notified .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/25</PHI>/94 .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/28</PHI>/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/94 .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute myocardial infarction .
urinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , Parkinson &apos;s disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> with a fever .
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease x &apos;s 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall .
He reports lower abdominal pain x&apos;s 2 days .
They went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
MEDICATIONS ; On admission were Eldepryl , Artane , Prilodol , Sinemet and Opuputine .
A head CT was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .
Head CT results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Factor</PHI> agreed he would review the CTs and follow the patient while in house .
He was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms .
He was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .
The patient &apos;s mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Arnsperni Health</PHI> services .
He did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued .
Thus , he was considered ready for discharge .
He again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .
He was switched over the Clinda and Gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/10</PHI>/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic .
Brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
He was hypotensive into the 80s .
He had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .
He was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .
He was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on Dobutamine for pressure support .
He was diuresed with Lasix and Diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated .
He was dynamically stable on his Dobutamine with improved oxygenation .
He had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .
His neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .
Discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities .
They were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction .
The lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .
The patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .
No further blood draws were done .
The patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous Morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .
Comfort measures continued until the day <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 , where Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Koteleebdils</PHI> was found to be pulseless , without respirations .
He was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 .
The family and the attending physician were notified .

Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Rule</PHI> is a 75 year old woman who is status post sigmoid resection for Duke &apos;s C2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/8</PHI>/96 with abdominal pain and neutropenia .
She first presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1990 with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke &apos;s B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .
She then represented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1996 with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .
At the time of surgery there was no evidence of liver disease .
Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .
One of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .
She was therefore staged Dukes C2 .
An abdominal CT scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .
She is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .
She presented to the Hematology / Oncology Clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/5</PHI>/96 for evaluation of possible adjuvant chemotherapy .
She was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aacent Slentjae</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Linatpromehack Worth Hospital</PHI> for Radiation Therapy .
She began treatment on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/20</PHI>/96 .
She subsequently had three days of IV bolus 5-FU chemotherapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">June 25th</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th</PHI> of 1996 , which she tolerated well .
She had unremarkable lumbosacral films , except for degenerative joint disease .
However , they were unable to rule out a soft tissue abnormality at L5 encroaching on a neural foramen .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in 1992.
(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .
Cardiac catheterization showed sequential LAD and she underwent angioplasty twice to the LAD with good results .
An echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 1994 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% .
Her baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block .
(3) Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
(4) Osteoporosis .
(5) Hypercholesterolemia .
(6) History of herpes zoster .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenni Pain</PHI> .
A KUB performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .
This was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .
She was admitted and made NPO .
She was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
She was also placed on neutropenic precautions .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .
Of note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .
Of note , shortly after starting on her TPN her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and TPN was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .
She was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
We recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .
During this time she will continue to receive TPN .
In addition to the above , she has the following additives :
Therefore , her total potassium is 60 mEq per liter , total sodium is 30 , and total phosphate is 20 .

Head and neck examination was benign .
There were no spider angiomata .
The heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained PMI which was located in the left mid clavicular line , S1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .
It radiates to both carotids bilaterally .
There was also a blowing holosystolic murmur heard at the patient &apos;s apex to axilla .
There was no S3 appreciated .

CAUSE OF DEATH :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">5/19</PHI>/95 at 3:15 a.m.
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> is a 59-year-old gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , alcoholic cirrhosis , and rectal cancer , who was scheduled for a resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the Medicine team for improvement of his heart failure .
He has mitral regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and an aortic valve area of 1.1 cm. squared with a peak gradient of 36 to 54 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% .
Cirrhosis .
Atrial fibrillation since 1990 .
Recurrent urinary tract infections .
Mitral valve regurgitation of 4+ .
Tricuspid regurgitation .
Aortic stenosis .
Cellulitis and sepsis in 1992 .
Hyponatremia .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Lasix 40 mg. b.i.d. Tagamet 400 mg. b.i.d. Lisinopril 10 mg. q. day .
Digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day .
ALLERGIES :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His temperature was 99 .
Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air .
He had jugular venous distention to the level of the jaw in the upright position .
His chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one-halfway up the chest .
His abdomen was soft and nontender with a positive fluid wave and a liver edge 3 cm. below the costal margin .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the Medicine Service and diuresed with Lasix and started on Captopril with the Lisinopril discontinued .
After aggressive diuresis on the Medical Service , he was deemed stable for surgery .
His fluids were very strongly restricted , and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the Operating Room with 400 cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated .
He was taken to the Post-Surgical Intensive Care Unit , intubated and stable .
His status , however , remained volatile , and in keeping his volume status somewhat on the dry side to optimize his pulmonary status , he became relatively oliguric and hypernatremic .
He required some fluid boluses with D-5-W to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/14</PHI>/95 , he returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for very aggressive pulmonary toilet .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/17</PHI> , he spiked a temperature to 103 with rigors and shaking chills .
At that time , multiple discussions were held with the family , and they decided to enact a Do Not Resuscitate order .
His white blood cell count rose to 22,000 with a 50% bandemia .
A Swan-Ganz catheter revealed an SVR of 350 , and he was started on Neo-Synephrine and Epinephrine prior to the Do Not Resuscitate order .
Throughout the day on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/18</PHI>/95 , his blood pressure continued to fall in the 80s , then 70s , then 60s , and at 3:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/19</PHI>/95 , despite multiple pressors , his blood pressure dropped down to 50 ; he then went into ventricular fibrillation , followed by flat line .
At that time , he had no spontaneous respirations and no audible heart tones .
He was pronounced dead at 3:15 a.m.
A postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
UNIT NUMBER :
ADMISSION DATE :
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">07/29</PHI>/2004
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Secondary neoplasm of bone ( extensive ) .
2. Primary malignant neoplasm of the breast ( resected ) .
4. Depression .
6. Anemia of chronic disease .
7. Hypercalcemia .
8. History of perforated gastric ulcer treated with hemigastrectomy <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/2004 .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Radiation therapy to the right clavicle <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/16</PHI>/2004 .
She had actually completed her five years of Tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch .
She ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain .
She had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness .
There had been no focal neurologic changes .
Up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease .
She had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement .
The rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Bilirubin normal .
A urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells .
A CA 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .
This was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site .
She had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of Physical Therapy .
Her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .
Escalate the doses of the Dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o&apos;clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on Remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional SSRI overlap until it seems to show more affect .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Zofran 8 mg p.o. q.8 p.r.n. nausea .
Tylenol 1-2 tabs q.4 p.r.n. pain .
Multivitamin , Megace 200 mg p.o. q.d. ( appetite stimulant ) .
Nexium 20 mg q.d. Femora ( letrazole ) 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. Polyethylene glycol ( Miralax ) 17 gm p.o. q.d. Dilaudid 4 mg p.o. q.4 hours p.r.n. breakthrough pain .

ALLERGIES :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 5 year old male with multiple anomalies transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Capa An- Medical Center</PHI> of <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/20</PHI> for management of airway obstruction secondary to tracheal stenosis / history of difficult intubations .
The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and intubations .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/10</PHI>/90 the patient had surgery to remove granulomas in the trachea after traumatic intubation for seizures .
The patient first presented with stridor and respiratory distress on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/92 .
A bronchoscopy at that time showed a 50% tracheal stenosis .
Since then the patient has had intermittent episodes of stridor with agitation with upper respiratory tract infections .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/19</PHI>/92 the patient awoke with significant stridor , respiratory distress and the use of accessory muscles .
The patient was taken to the emergency room where he was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/19</PHI>/92 direct laryngoscopy showed an 80% tracheal stenosis beginning just below the sternal notch involving the proximal 50th percent of the trachea .
The patient was a difficult intubation and it was finally performed by a thoracic surgeon using a 3.5 endotracheal tube .
The patient was then hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Asney Ewood Health Care</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Losbroke Pringda Field Delp U</PHI> and maintained with Pavulon and Morphine .
The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health immediately prior to this hospitalization with no history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms , fever , cough , vomiting , diarrhea or decreased appetite .
1. Respiratory :
The patient remained intubated and maintained on a Pavulon and Morphine drip through until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/92 .
The patient was noted to have a stenosis of the proximal trachea approximately 3 cm long just below the vocal cords .
The patient was also noted to have mild right mainstem bronchus stenosis too .
Very mild .
The patient had a 3-0 Shiley trach placed approximately 1 cm below the vocal cords .
The trach extends approximately 1 cm below the area of stenosis .
I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative .
There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia that could have precipitated this event and all X-Rays have been unremarkable .
The patient has a history of significant hyperinflation of the chest with an increased AP diameter which is mildly improved after the tracheostomy .
The patient received oxygen for approximately 24 hours after the tracheostomy and is presently being maintained on room air with a humidified mask .
Cardiac :
The patient had some evidence of doubled T waves on the day of arrival .
These T waves have since cleared and the patient is otherwise unremarkable .
Please note that the last arterial blood gases was Ph 7.40 , PCO2 of 41 , PO2 of 112 , bicarbonate of 25 .
Fluids and Nutrition :
The patient was initially NPO and then begun on Pediasure feeds the first two days of hospitalization .
The patient has presently been weaned over to his regular diet which is generally some crackers , cereal and occasional bits of food .
GI :
This was felt to be mild aspiration .
The patient also had episodes of frequent coughing .
KUB on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/23</PHI> showed hugely dilated loops of colon and small bowel which only briefly respond to an enema .
The patient last received enema on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/24</PHI> in the p.m.
HEM :
The patient has generally been stable .
His initial hematocrit was 31% .
His hematocrit on transfer was 33% .
The patient never received blood during the procedure .
Renal :
The patient has always had good urine output with normal BUN and creatinine .
Neurological :
The patient has a history of of seizure disorder .
He has been stable here .
Levels on arrival showed a Phenobarbital level of 25 , Tegretrol level of 3.1 .
The patient has had problems taking p.o. Tegretol during this hospitalization and levels need to be checked in the near future .
Infectious Disease :
The patient arrived receiving ceftriaxone for one day down in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</PHI> .
The child only had a one time spike on pod 1 to 103 .
Three trach aspirates have all been unremarkable .
The blood cultures are unremarkable , sputum cultures are unremarkable , urinalysis was also negative .
The trach appears to be quite stable and the patient is tolerating having his trach in quite nicely with a humidified mask .
The plans per ENT are that the patient &apos;s trach will not be changed for at least one months time .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> will contact Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Roosekote</PHI> as to probable plans .
It appears that Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> wants to re-evaluate the child in 4 to 6 weeks with another bronchoscopy and feels that possibly tracheal reconstruction may be possible at that time .
The parents are being transferred back to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Newstonpend</PHI> to learn trach care and to set up homecare .
If you have any questions please contact me .
There is always someone here .
Additional laboratory data of note is a last white blood count on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/24</PHI> was 9,000 with a differential of 70 polys , 25% lymphs , hemoglobin 10.1 , platelet count 351,000 .
Electrolytes were normal on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/23</PHI>/92 and the last gas was as stated above .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC CERVICAL CARCINOMA .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION , PULMONARY LYMPHANGITIC SPREAD , AND LIVER AND SPLEEN METASTASES .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Echocardiogram times two .
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
On ultrasound in <PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
She was evaluated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mielke</PHI> , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .
She was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Weekscook University Medical Center</PHI> with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
She was therefore transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .
HEENT :
NECK :
No lymphadenopathy .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .
PELVIC :
No masses .
RECTAL :
No masses and guaiac negative .
EXTREMITIES :
No edema or cyanosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .
PT and PTT were 12 and 26 .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/11</PHI> .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .
Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .
She was hooked up with support services in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961</PHI> for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/22</PHI>/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mielke</PHI> and home care services .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Premarin 0.625 q.d. , Proventil Inhaler two puffs q.i.d. , Beclovent four puffs b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , MS Contin 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Trilisate 750 mg p.o. b.i.d. , MS Elixir 100 mg p.o. q.2h. p.r.n. , Robitussin with Codeine 5 cc p.o. q.2h. , and home O2 two liters via nasal prong with increase to four liters as needed for symptoms p.r.n.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , right frontal infarct , hypertension , and question progressive supranuclear palsy .
magnetic resonance imaging of the brain on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/96 .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Granrivern Call</PHI> is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
He was later seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Flo Cuchkote</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
There was no definite clonic activity .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Coumadin 4 mgs po qhs , Vasotec 5 mgs po qd , Lasix prn , Digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , Proscar and Sinemet .
ALLERGIES :
1) atrial fibrillation on coumadin ,
3) Question progressive supranuclear palsy .
5) hypertension .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
He is a former professor at <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</PHI> .
He was a previous drinker of one &quot; old fashioned &quot; every night .
FAMILY HISTORY :
He has a father who had dementia .
vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .
In general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .
head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .
His neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits .
Lungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .
Neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice .
He had no blink to threat .
His pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left .
He had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally .
He had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace .
He had no gag to tube manipulation .
Motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .
His deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 .
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
chest x-ray clear .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 18</PHI> , 1996 .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
3) PULMONARY :
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 19</PHI> , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
Stable .
The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .

RESIDUAL SKULL BASE CHORDOMA
DIS
<PHI TYPE="DATE">02/06</PHI>/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CHORDOMA .
PROCEDURE :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> is a 60 year-old man presented with a two year history with right neck pain .
An initial CT scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> , 1996 showed a right wedge skull base mass .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , 1997 he underwent cerebral angiography complicated by an embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia .
He was taken to the Intensive Care Unit .
A follow-up MRI showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke .
He was treated with aspirin .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">November 19</PHI> , 1997 , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy .
Postoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received Gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a PEG was preformed .
He was discharged home with at follow-up MRI and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 25</PHI> , 1997 again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla .
He is taking some liquids p.o. but also has G-tube feedings q.2h.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Status post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote .
DIET :
Jevity Plus one can q.12h. by G-tube , some liquids .
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to Codeine which causes nausea and Morphine which causes swelling .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin discontinued in two weeks prior to admission .
Denies use of alcohol and tobacco .
General :
Lungs are clear to auscultation .
Heart regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Neurological alert and oriented times three , speech is fluent although there is some difficulty of tongue movement .
Cranial nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right .
Strength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities .
Deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing .
Cerebella intact .
Gait steady .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Postoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .
He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .
On postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .
A lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .
A culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .
He was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .
A video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .
Because of continuing complaints by Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .
He underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Feb 04</PHI> , 1997 .
Prior to admission Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .
It was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .
His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .
His lumbar drain was removed after five days .
He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .
He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .
He will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .
Follow-up will be with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Sick</PHI> in one weeks time .

DEATH SUMMARY
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
He underwent salvage chemotherapy and again went into remission .
Significant for hypertension .
Right mastectomy for benign lesion .
His physical examination was noteable only for the following .
Cardiac exam was normal .
Abdomen was benign .
The remainder of his physical examination was normal except for decreased vibration and position sense in the distal fingers and toes .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed a normal SMA-7 except for potassium of 3.1 .
White blood cell count was 4.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent conditioning with Cytoxan , VP-16 , and VCNU .
His initial hospital course was complicated by the following :
Despite this , the fevers persisted until he no longer was neutropenic .
2. Renal occlusive disease :
Starting on approximately day 14 , the patient developed signs of renal occlusive disease with increasing bilirubin .
This progressed inexorably until he developed massive ascites and marked hyperbilirubinemia .
Towards the end of the hospitalization , his bilirubins were in the high 30&apos;s and low 40&apos;s .
He received multiple transfusions with coloids , including red blood cells and albumin .
Despite maximal efforts with coloids , renal range dopamine and Lasix , the patient &apos;s creatinine continued to rise .
Because of mechanical limitations imposed by his ascites , the patient had severe tachypnea and required supplemental oxygen to maintain his oxygenation .
The patient &apos;s clinical situation continued to deteriorate and he died on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/9</PHI>/90 at 4:30 a.m.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
End-stage renal disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Right nephrectomy .
2. Cadaveric renal transplant .
3. Acute thrombosis .
5. Pulmonary emboli .
6. Hypertension .
9. Hypercoagulable state .
12. Sepsis .
13. Respiratory failure .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .
A pulmonary arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/03</PHI>/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/19</PHI>/97 .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/06</PHI>/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .
The patient remained unstable .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/08</PHI>/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Less</PHI> continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Less</PHI> condition was irretrievable .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Cantsleddjesc</PHI> felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/16</PHI>/98 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Laymie Fournier</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leebjescobe</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia</PHI> who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center</PHI> .
He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He was started on aspirin .
A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .
Head , neck :
unremarkable .
Lungs clear .
Carotids normal .
Cardiac :
Loud S4 and a II / VI regurgitant murmur .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological :
Nonfocal .
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 243 .
Hematocrit on admission was 43% with a white blood count of 6600 .
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .
This lowered with IV nitroglycerin .
He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/02</PHI>/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Thorebreutz</PHI> took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .
A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ryna Jescdrig</PHI> .
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/05</PHI> it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 63 year old patient who had no significant medical history until 1987 , when he developed a left arm embolism which was treated with SVG from the left thigh .
The postop course was uncomplicated with an embolus occluding the graft and a CVA .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">04</PHI>-90 , the patient suffered an intestinal embolism requiring an ileostomy which was closed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>-90 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>-90 , the patient developed a second CVA presenting with slurred speech which resolved without residual .
He also complains of continued left arm paresthesias .
The patient also reports that he had a large silent MI in <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>-89 , which was uncomplicated .
After admission to the Medical Service , the patient underwent work up for embolism source and source for his dizziness .
His search had previously been negative .
This finding was in concurrence with findings of a cardiac cath performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-12</PHI>-92 .
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Service for the removal of this left ventricular mass .
After the usual preparation , the patient was taken to the OR on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-14</PHI>-92 , and underwent left ventriculotomy and removal of the left ventricular thrombus .
The pathological examination of the removed material revealed a blood clot with thrombus .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
During the early postop period , he was kept on IV Dextran and was restarted on Coumadin .
His further postop course was complicated by a recurrent episode of dizziness .
A repeat echo showed no recurrent intraventricular thrombus and a carotid Doppler study was negative .
The patient suffered no further dizzy spells during the further postop days .
He was discharged in good condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-22</PHI>-92 .

Anterior tibialis and extensor hallucis longus were 5 bilaterally , as well as the gastrocnemii .
Gait was decreased arm swing , slightly wide-based , negative Romberg , mildly unsteady .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent placement of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02-19</PHI>-91 .
She tolerated the procedure well and was actually , the following day , slightly drowsy , but did better than preoperatively while in the hospital .
She was able to ambulate with some assistance , was less sleepy and slow in her affect , able to swallow , passed her swallow study , and had an episode while in the house of shortness of breath , two episodes , with an electrocardiogram that did not show any change , and a chest x-ray showed a question of failure .
For this reason , a cardiology consult was called .
They recommended starting the patient on Lasix and doing cardiac echo .
On Lasix , the patient &apos;s BUN and creatinine started rising , and the echocardiogram revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular hyper-trophy and decreased compliance .
It was felt that the patient was slightly dehydrated .
Lasix was stopped .
The patient did well without any further episodes of shortness of breath , and she was discharged to a rehabilitation facility .
At that point she should have a CT scan .
The patient was placed on iron for a hematocrit of about 31 .
Her discharge MEDICATIONS are iron 324 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Decadron 4 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. once daily ; phenobarbital 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. ; heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously q. 12 hours .
The patient received physical therapy while in the hospital , and will receive some therapy at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Son Talken Bryn Hospital</PHI> .
She had a shunt series which shows an intact , and she should be followed up for this with Doctor <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Besti Lou</PHI> .

On admission , hematocrit was 37 , baseline creatinine .9 .
postoperatively , her hematocrit fell to as low as 23.8 , for which she was transfused up to hematocrit of 33 and remained stable between 30 and 33 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to surgery on the day of admission , where she underwent exploratory laparotomy and a 5-centimeter tumor mass was identified , which was adherent and possibly intrinsic to the sigmoid colon , and also noted were firm and large periaortic lymph nodes bilaterally .
Postoperatively , the patient &apos;s course was complicated initially by a falling hematocrit , which was transfused and then remained stable .
The she continued to have low-grade postoperative fevers until approximately 8 days postoperatively when her temperature spiked .
A pelvic ultrasound was obtained , which showed a large fluid collection in the pelvis .
This collection was tapped and found to be blood mixed with pus .
A drain was placed under ultrasound guidance and cultures were sent .

4. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
6. CERVICAL POLYPS
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .
Patient also received AICD .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
Patient &apos;s past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
Since that time the patient has been treated medically .
Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .
Coronaries were completely normal .
In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .
Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .
Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .
Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
Furthermore , due to the patient &apos;s long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .
The patient did well at home until <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/31</PHI>/94 when she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Souland</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nixmont Bovo</PHI> with increasing congestive heart failure .
At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .
By report , in the interim since discharge from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .
She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20</PHI>/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Alllo Eino Hospital</PHI> which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient &apos;s arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient &apos;s hospitalization without difficulty .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/22</PHI>/94 an EPS study was performed .
The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .
Consequently AICD placement was recommended .
Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .
Thus , AICD placement was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/10</PHI>/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .
It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Vonamemp , LA</PHI> via plane by herself .
This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Type II diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps .
NKDA .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Positive tobacco history although the patient quit approximately 1 year ago .
History of alcohol formerly 6 pack per day long-standing , however , the patient currently does not use alcohol .
FAMILY HISTORY :

NECK :
Supple with 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally , negative for bruits .
Jugular venous pressure approximately 8 cm , negative for lymphadenopathy .
CARDIOVASCULAR :

As mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation .
As per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 .
Hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to AICD placement .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is discharged to home in stable condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/94 .
At the time of discharge , the patient was on Coumadin 2 mg q.h.s. , K-Dur 20 mEq po q.d. , magnesium oxide 420 mg po q.d. , Isordil 10 mg po t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg po q.d. , Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. , Digoxin .25 mg po q.d. , Captopril 25 mg po t.i.d. , Beclovent inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. , Proventil inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. , Tylenol #3 1 tablet 30 mg po q. 2-3 hours times 1 day prn pain or discomfort .

Wolfe-Parkinson White Syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay Memorial Hospital Of</PHI> for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .
His cardiac risk factors include :
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of chest pain and in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .
He subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .
He was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .
He underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Slusslashgodle</PHI> which were unsuccessful .
He was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .
He was discharged home but returned on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/13</PHI>/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .
He was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .
He continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation and management .
Prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .
Sotalol 160 mg bid .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
Aspirin .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
ALLERGIES :
He reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .
There was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .
However , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .
His lungs were clear throughout .
His apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .
Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .
BUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .
His creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .
His hematocrit was 49.3 .
His electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
His initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .
His right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .
He had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .
His left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .
There was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .
Mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .
There were no complications .
In following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .
There were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .
His Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .
His INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .
Accordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .
Given his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/23</PHI>/98 .
FOLLOW-UP :
He will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Taarnna Service</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> as well as Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lupevickette Folk</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Dwainco Rallsversgach</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Villean Garl</PHI> .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Sotalol 120 mg bid .
Coumadin 5 mg qhs or as directed for four weeks .
Aricept 10 mg qhs .
CZI insulin two units q am .
Resulin 400 mg qd .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .
Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 20</PHI> , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .
Pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .
Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 20</PHI> of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .
Idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .
However , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .
A single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 20</PHI> indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .

She was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .
She did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
She denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .
She was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .
There was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .
Apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ez Ephtro Health Center</PHI> where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .

She had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
Oral cavity was normal .
Neck :
Otherwise normal and the trachea was midline .
The left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
The right pyriform was narrowed by edema .
The epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .
The patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .
There was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .
Lungs :
Clear .
Heart :
S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .
No masses .
Extremities :
Normal .
Back :
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Revealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .
The chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
Due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .
The patient was sedated .
At the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .
Her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
She had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .
She was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .
EKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .
She continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .
Her blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/5</PHI>/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .
She was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .
Otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .
Of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .
Once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .
Tube feedings were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/3</PHI>/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/5</PHI>/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .
After extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
O2 saturations looked good .
It was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .
Her white counts came down .
Blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .
She had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .
Nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .
DISPOSITION :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/9</PHI>/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .
Our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .
She , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
If she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">3/23</PHI>/95
<PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1) Obstructive jaundice , secondary to recurrent tumor and / or stricture at the bile duct to jejunum anastomosis .
2) Subhepatic fluid collection , drained .
3) Clostridium difficile colitis with diarrhea .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , replacement of permanent biliary stents and liver biopsy .
The patient is a 55-year-old man who is status post resection of a Klatskin tumor , who returns with persistent jaundice and right upper quadrant pain .
The present illness is marked by presentation with jaundice and pain in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 1994 , and a computerized tomography scan that showed bile duct dilatation .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> 1994 , the Klatskin tumor was resected and it was shown to be moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma .
The surgical margins were positive and he was treated postoperatively with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
Since that time he had been persistently jaundiced and fatigued , until three weeks prior to admission when the patient had a biliary tube check , which showed things to be patent despite his rising bilirubin .
He presented now for evaluation of failed biliary drainage .
On physical examination , he had a normal temperature and blood pressure .
His head and neck showed marked scleral icterus and a cardiac examination showed a systolic ejection murmur .
The extremities were unremarkable .
Rectal examination was negative and his neurological examination was intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
His hematocrit was 25.8% , with a normal white blood cell count .
His bilirubin was total 11.1 , with a direct bilirubin of 10.2 and his alkaline phosphatase was 2,188 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The computerized tomography scan showed dilated left and right hepatic ducts and was consistent with some form of blockage of the drainage arrangement .
What then ensued was multiple attempts to insure adequate biliary decompression by use of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram and placement of biliary catheters and stents .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/95 and <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , very mild revisions were made of these and the feeling was that solution had been reached with good drainage .
He was feeling much better , taking good diet and denying pain or fever .
During the course of the hospitalization , he was found to have diarrhea and stool was sent and found to be positive for Clostridium difficile toxin and this initiated treatment with Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for two weeks .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , it was deemed he was ready for discharge and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Blinjesc</PHI> discharged him to the care of his primary physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ma</PHI> , in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Taette</PHI> .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE :
are Glyburide 5-15 mg po q a.m. and 0-10 mg po q p.m. , depending on amount of oral intake ; Celesone 1 1/2 tablets po q day , Tagamet 400 mg PO b.i.d. , ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d. , CZI sliding scale which will not be continued on discharge , and Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for a total of fourteen days .

1. Primary central nervous system lymphoma .
2. Pancytopenia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old right hand dominant white female with a history of primary central nervous system lymphoma , diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1994 , status post twelve cycles of high dose methotrexate , status post two cycles of high dose ARA-C chemotherapy , who was admitted with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and decreasing platelet count .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 1994 patient developed 2-3 months of headaches , cognitive changes , dizziness and memory loss .
The patient underwent a biopsy which showed a primary CNS lymphoma .
The patient was reinduced with high dose methotrexate , 8 mg / meter sq. with some initial tumor response .
However , when the patient was started on 3.5 gm / meter sq. maintenance dose , the tumor progressed .
At that point , the patient was switched over toe high-dose ARA-C ( 2.5 gm / meter sq ) .
On the day of admission the patient &apos;s platelet count dropped to 28,000 and the patient was admitted for her platelet transfusions and further work up for her rectal bleeding .
The patient complained of chronic constipation and rectal bleeding after each bowel movement .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/25</PHI>/95 :
white blood count 5,000 , hematocrit 38 , platelet count 50,000 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 26</PHI> , white blood count 2.5 , hematocrit 29 , platelet count 32,000 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 27</PHI> , white blood count 1.6 , hematocrit 28.9 , platelet count 28,000 :
66 polys , 8 bands with ANC of 1056 .
The patient developed substernal chest pain without radiation on the night of admission .
An electrocardiogram showed flat ST change in lead III , otherwise unremarkable and the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin without symptomatic improvement .
The patient was given 2 units of packed RBC along with the six units of platelet transfusion .
The patient &apos;s symptoms improved with the above measures and the patient no longer complained of chest pain during the hospitalization .
Because of significant neutropenia , the patient was put on reverse isolation and started on GCSF injections .
The patient &apos;s hemoglobin improved to 10.0 after the transfusion and her rectal bleeding apparently stopped .
A GI consultation was made and they felt that the rectal bleeding is most likely from the hemorrhoids and no further intervention was felt to be necessary .
After the transfusion the patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 101,000 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 2</PHI> .
However , in lieu of a persistent bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy , it was decided that she should undergo radiation therapy .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Decadron 6 mg po tid ; and she should continue Inderal , Synthroid and Zoloft at the present dose and frequency .
The patient was instructed to call us with any clinical or neurological symptoms .
The patient will have a follow up complete blood count with differential on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI>

Brain MRI , <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/12</PHI>/94 .
Placement of chest tube for bleomycin sclerotherapy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/20</PHI>/94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 68 year old female who presented to the emergency room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/22</PHI> with a chief complaint of increasing dyspnea .
In addition , she had insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a recent myocardial infarction in the <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> of 1994 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20</PHI> she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Secla Berl Spo Hospital</PHI> with a chief complaint of chest discomfort and dyspnea .
She presented with wide complex tachycardia and congestive heart failure .
She eventually ruled in for a myocardial infarction and was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/21</PHI> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , she was an elderly female in moderate respiratory distress , blood pressure 100/60 , respirations 26 , pulse 68 , temperature afebrile .
Her jugular venous pressure was within normal limits .
Arterial pulse contours were diminished bilaterally .
A soft systolic ejection murmur was audible at the base .
No S3 was present .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds present and no pulsatile masses evident .
There was 2+ lower extremity edema evident .
No grossly evident focal neurological findings were noted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Crestwall Hospital</PHI> , where a therapeutic thoracentesis was performed in order to alleviate her dyspnea .
Cytology was positive for moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma .
A chest CT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/24</PHI> demonstrated a right lower lobe mass as well as significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy .
A cardiac ultrasound study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Memorial Day</PHI> demonstrated an aortic stenosis with a calculated valve area of .6 square cm .
An enhancing focus in the left thalamus was thought to represent a subacute infarct .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Margmimaui Jesclinke</PHI> was consulted and helped significantly with the day to day management of the patient &apos;s COPD and frequent desaturations in the setting of a large , recurrent right pleural effusion .
Over the weekend of <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/30</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/01</PHI> , her condition further deteriorated , and she was started on a morphine drip .
She did not respond to intravenous diuretics or renal dose dopamine .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cean Leach</PHI> is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ville , Virginia</PHI> for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .
He was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l988 .
He was treated at that time with TPA .
A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .
He did well until he developed recurrent angina in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .
He again did well until approximately late l992 .
Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with recurrent chest pain .
He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40&apos;s and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l994 at 31% .
He was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with a typical episode of this discomfort in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
He was transferred at that time to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
That was his first <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> admission .
Because of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .
His angiograms from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .
He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 13</PHI> , 1994 .
There he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .
Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
Specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .
Following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .
He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .
However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .
Starting in the <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
He had multiple admissions to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .
His medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .
His most recent admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> is on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 5</PHI> , of 1994 .
Because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-9</PHI>-94 .
There is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .
His medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .
His heart rate was 88 .
His abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .
His femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .
He had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .
His BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .
Glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .
His fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .
His liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .
His hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .
The right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .
That is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .
Impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .
Repeat in vitro testing of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .
While in the hospital , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .
Multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .
He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .
Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .
Factor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .
Thrombin time and repalase time were normal .
His APC resistance was normal .
His compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .
Because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .
To evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .
Prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 13</PHI> .
That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .
On the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .
This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .
After extended discussions with pain service , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> was brought back down to the pain clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 27</PHI> .
There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .
Once again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .
After extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .
He tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .
He had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 27</PHI> , 1995 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Thoracoabdominal aneurysm .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">2/17</PHI>/94 :
resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm .
HISTORY :
At that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riode Zetllille</PHI> for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .
The patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .
Since the patient &apos;s last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her head and neck examination is within normal limits .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm .
She has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass .
Extremities :
are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .
She has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .
Is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .
EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .
There were no intraoperative complications .
The patient &apos;s procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .
The patient remained intubated postoperatively .
She had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .
On postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .
Epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .
She was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .
This was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .
Laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels .
Neurological consultation was obtained .
It was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .
MRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .
She was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .
Social Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .
The patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .
The patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .
She was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
COMPLICATIONS :
During this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riode Zetllille</PHI> and she is to maintain rehabilitation care at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Laelk Memorial Hospital</PHI> .

Documented .
Diarrhea responded initially to Paromomicin , but subsequent medical compliance was poor .
4. Cerebral toxoplasmosis , stable , on suppressive therapy .
Titer stable at 1:8 on suppressive therapy .
7. Weight loss , presumably secondary to Cryptococcosis , and AIDS .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Skin :

The patient was treated with PPN and elemental diet , for correction of metabolic disturbances , improved fluid balance , and nutritional support .
Paromomycin was continued until his supply was used up , and charithromycin was continued .
His diarrhea diminished .
However , KUB showed persistent change , consistent with ileus or early partial small bowel obstruction .
On this admission and on previous outpatient laboratory data , potassium and phosphorus tended to be very low so Neutra-Phos K was continued at discharge .
Lomotil was held at discharge because of question of ileus , but may be reinstituted at a very low dose , for example , 1-2 per day .

He was treated with Vincristine , followed several days later by Bleomycin , with return of his condition to somewhat better than baseline on admission .
It was planned to give him one more dose of Vincristine prior to discharge .
There was a decrease in CBC , which was ascribed to AZT , which was discontinued .
4. Chronic VZV :
Acyclovir was initiated .

Discharge Date :
INDUCIBLE COMPLETE HEART BLOCK .
The patient is an 81 year old woman with a history of hypertension , history of recurrent VPBs , admitted for investigation following a syncopal episode two weeks prior to admission .
The patient has a history of ventricular premature beats for which she was treated with Flecainide .
After the syncopal episode the patient was evaluated at a local hospital with head and abdominal CT , EEG , and EKG , all of which were normal .
The patient has history of VPBs as noted above , treated with Flecainide with good symptomatic response .
Following discontinuation of this drug the patient noted return of palpitations .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Left mastectomy in 1982 for breast carcinoma .
History of upper GI bleeding in 1985 while on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines .
ALLERGIES :
None known .
Vaseretic 10 mg p.o.q.d. , Calan SR 240 mg p.o.q.d. , Motrin 600 mg p.o. prn , Cytotec prn with Motrin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
She is a nonsmoker , nondrinker .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Showed bruises over both her knees .
HEENT :
Within normal limits .
Neck :
Supple without lympadenopathy .
No JVD .
Lungs :
Clear .
COR :
There was a soft right carotid and right femoral bruit .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , without masses .
CNS :
Alert and oriented .
Cranial nerves intact .
Sensory motor examination was grossly intact .
Extremities :
Showed nodes in both hands and crepitans of both knees .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
LFTs were normal .
Cholesterol 252 .
Chest x-ray normal .
EKG was within normal limits .
UA was normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a history of syncope for cardiac evaluation .
She was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where a catheterization revealed an 80% mid-RCA stenosis , 80% mid-LAD lesion and an LVEF of approximately 80% .
It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient &apos;s episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress .
On the following day , she was taken to electrophysiologic study .
During the study , the right bundle branch was hit by the catheter , inducing a right bundle branch block .
It was felt that given this rate-related block on the left , combined with the possibility of physiologic malfunction on the right , complete heart block as the source of the patient &apos;s syncopal episode was quite possible and plans were made to insert a VVI pacer .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is discharged home .
Followup with primary physician in one week .
Discharge condition good .

SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/05</PHI>/94 .
Gastrojejunostomy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/08</PHI>/94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a <PHI TYPE="AGE">111y</PHI> year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/01</PHI> complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/93 , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/24</PHI> she was taken to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Rys Memorial Hospital</PHI> hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and admitted there from <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/25</PHI> - <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/03</PHI> .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The stones were then removed .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .
She was admitted for workup of her symptoms .
As above ; appendectomy in 1916 , hysterectomy in 1941 , mastoid surgery in 1970 , shingles of right arm in 1994 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin daily .
She has no known drug allergies .
She does not smoke and has rare alcohol intake .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Her mother died of an unspecified tumor .
The patient was a pleasant elderly female in no acute distress .
Vital signs :
HEENT :
The neck was supple with shotty lymphadenopathy , 2+ carotids without bruits .
regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Chest :
Abdomen :
distended , bowel sounds present , tympanitic to percussion anteriorly , dull to percussion laterally .
no edema .
no masses , lesions or nipple discharge .
No axillary lymphadenopathy .
Neurological :

Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was seen in consultation by the Gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
The General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/08</PHI> a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
The patient &apos;s subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
Stable .
