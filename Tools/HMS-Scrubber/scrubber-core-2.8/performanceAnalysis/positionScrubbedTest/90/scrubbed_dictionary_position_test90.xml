Cerebral vascular accident .

She has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .
Her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
The patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .
After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .
Initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .
I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .

Dry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .
ABDOMEN :
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
She should have a follow up echocardiogram .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be xxxPOSITIONxxx evidence of tamponade .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive xxxPOSITIONxxx further Ifex .
Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .
