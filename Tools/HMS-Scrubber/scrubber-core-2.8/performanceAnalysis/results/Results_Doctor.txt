Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg xxxPEOPLExxx q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate xxxPEOPLExxx intake to maintain her volume status .
