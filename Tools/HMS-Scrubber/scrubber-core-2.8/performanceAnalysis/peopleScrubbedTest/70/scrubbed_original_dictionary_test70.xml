PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
ALLERGIES :
Sulfonamides .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .
Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection xxxPEOPLExxx of 40% , by gated cardiac blood xxxPEOPLExxx scanning .
Over these past xxxxAGE6xxxx , he has remained xxxPEOPLExxx on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .
He returned for routine office evaluation on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/93 , complaining of xxxxAGE6xxxx of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .
Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .
The liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the xxxPEOPLExxx costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .
Later , an echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .
potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine xxxxDATE22xxxx 7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .
There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .
A large xxxPEOPLExxx ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .
The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the xxxPEOPLExxx marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .
We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wierst</PHI> and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .

The aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and B12 .
The medial region of the hematoma was felt to be suspicious for tumor versus arteriovenous malformation .
There was no enhancement xxxPEOPLExxx in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .
Given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar xxxPEOPLExxx This was followed up with a bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .
A cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for xxxPEOPLExxx effect from the hematoma .
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and G tube was performed at the same time .
This confirmed an 8 mm. xxxPEOPLExxx which was bright on T2 and homogeneous in the xxxPEOPLExxx lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with a benign hemangioma or cyst .
The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .
He awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .
His Decadron has been tapered slowly to zero and his examination on discharge was as follows :
He sleeps with a hypophonia , but occasionally will speak louder when he is in better spirits .
His pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .

ADMISSION DATE :
DISCHARGED TO <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">SOUTHOBASSKING&apos;S VILLEMARG HOSPITAL</PHI> .
Acute polymicrobial bacterial endocarditis .
She was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .
There was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
There was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .
She had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
Because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .
Towards the end of <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .
She was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .
During her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .
She , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .
In the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .
The sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .
She was returned to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .
Her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .
With clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .
She subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .
Autopsy permission was granted .

The patient is disabled .
She was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated .
She was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated BUN and creatinine and failure to eat .
Her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection xxxPEOPLExxx noted to be 28 percent in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> of xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
She also has a history of urinary tract infection .
There was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .
She also has a history of xxxPEOPLExxx proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
However , she denied any chest xxxPEOPLExxx dyspnea or syncope .
On physical examination her pulse was xxxxADDRESS8xxxx appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .
Laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride xxxxADDRESS8xxxx urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .
A head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the xxxPEOPLExxx frontal and cerebellar lobes .
At that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , xxxPEOPLExxx of which were negative for temporal arteritis .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
However , she was unable to move her xxxPEOPLExxx arm or leg .
Her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a xxxPEOPLExxx facial droop .
A cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection xxxPEOPLExxx of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .
However , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate xxxPEOPLExxx intake to maintain her volume status .
Nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .
The patient will be transferred tomorrow to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Naplesvillechaelty</PHI> .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .
Other GI issues include the patient &apos;s hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .
Because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .
3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated xxxNAMExxx aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .
Several xxxPEOPLExxx tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the xxxPEOPLExxx tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .
The patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .
4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x xxxPEOPLExxx other than a xxxPEOPLExxx lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .
The patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x xxxPEOPLExxx No organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .
It was thought that a Foley catheter would be xxxPEOPLExxx appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .
He had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .
The patient continued to be asymptomatic .
The patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .
These issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .
8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .
The white count was 7.5 , platelets xxxxADDRESS8xxxx last PT and PTT on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx last xxxPEOPLExxx and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx  Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/95 , GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal xxxPEOPLExxx Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was xxxPEOPLExxx An echocardiogram was done .
The computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .
Because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx exploratory laparotomy was performed .
Drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor dependent .
Thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .
These resolved without incident .
The patient was also treated initially with amphotericin B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew Candida albicans .
The patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .
He remained xxxPEOPLExxx from a cardiac fashion .
He did have problems with xxxPEOPLExxx intake .
He had repeated bouts of small volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .
The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .
Multiple discussions were held between Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mass</PHI> , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient &apos;s wife , with this same result .

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Epogen and Vitamin B 12 injections .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
Soft , slightly distended , nontender .
No hernias .
The patient did have xxxPEOPLExxx costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .
There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .
There was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .
The Swan Ganz cathetxxxPEOPLExxxs confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .
Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the xxxPEOPLExxx spermatic xxxPEOPLExxx debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .
In the abdomen the patient &apos;s retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled off .
He was hydrated vigorously .
This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .
The patient &apos;s urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .

An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural xxxPEOPLExxx at the xxxPEOPLExxx posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was xxxPEOPLExxx consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral xxxPEOPLExxx lower extremity .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme xxxPEOPLExxx with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for xxxPEOPLExxx control during dressing changes .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is xxxPEOPLExxx consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :

Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .
The patient was admitted to the hospital on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-8</PHI>-94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the <PHI TYPE="ID">EXWAGH9T</PHI> protocol .
His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .
He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was xxxPEOPLExxx and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal xxxPEOPLExxx An X xxxPEOPLExxx at the time revealed free air .
He therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with xxxNAMExxx pouch creation and ileostomy creation .
At the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take down .
An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .
A Holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .
The patient was xxxPEOPLExxx in consultation and evaluated by Cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , Propanolol , and verapamil .

The remainder of his physical examination was normal except for decreased vibration and position sense in the distal fingers and toes .
The remainder of his laboratory studies were normal .
The patient underwent conditioning with Cytoxan , VP-16 , and VCNU .
His initial hospital course was complicated by the following :
The patient developed fever and neutropenia without any clear source .
Starting on approximately day 14 , the patient developed signs of renal occlusive disease with increasing bilirubin .
This progressed inexorably until he developed massive ascites and marked hyperbilirubinemia .
Despite aggressive supportive care , the patient &apos;s liver pathology did not resolve and he continued to have progressive hepatic failure .
Despite maximal efforts with coloids , renal range dopamine and Lasix , the patient &apos;s creatinine continued to rise .
4. Respiratory :
Because of mechanical limitations imposed by his ascites , the patient had severe tachypnea and required supplemental oxygen to maintain his oxygenation .

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his xxxNAMExxx xxxNAMExxx site and xxxPEOPLExxx oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
The patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx white male who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay xxxHOSPITALxxx Hospital Of</PHI> for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .
He was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI>/98 he was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay xxxHOSPITALxxx Hospital Of</PHI> with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .
He was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardxxxPEOPLExxxnd was treated with magnesium .
He continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardxxxPEOPLExxxnd was therefore transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph xxxxPRIVATExxx Of Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation and management .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin .
ALLERGIES :
He reports an allergy to xxxPEOPLExxx codeine and iodine .
However , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .
He was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was a grade xxxxDATE22xxxx holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .
Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .
His hematocrit was 49 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .
He had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .
He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .
In following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to xxxxADDRESS8xxxx Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .
His INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .
Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .
Given his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .
He will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Taarnna Service</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph xxxxPRIVATExxx Of Medical Center</PHI> as well as Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lupevickette Folk</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Dwainco Rallsversgach</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Villean Garl</PHI> .

<PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx EPIGLOTTITIS .
Of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .
She did not complain of significant xxxPEOPLExxx and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
He recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was xxxPEOPLExxx She presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .
She was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .
She was febrile to 101 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
None .
Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Neck :
Otherwise normal and the trachea was midline .
The xxxPEOPLExxx pyriform was narrowed by edema .
There was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .
Extremities :
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
She was taken to the Operating xxxxROOMxxxx 00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
At the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .
Her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after xxxPEOPLExxx the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
She had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .
She went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and xxxxADDRESS8xxxx <PHI TYPE="DATE" xxxxDATE22xxxx /PHI>/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .
Tube feedings were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI>/91 and the xxxPEOPLExxx tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE" xxxxDATE22xxxx /PHI>/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .
After extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
It was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .
She had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .
Nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .
Her mental status began to clear under the family &apos;s request .

He was treated at that time with TPA .
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant xxxPEOPLExxx coronary artery or his left coronary system .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
His xxxPEOPLExxx recent admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> is on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , of xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .
There is no history of drug abuse or smoking .
His jugular venous pressure was normal .
His abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .
Glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .
His hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .
the primary concern upon Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .
The left ventricular pressure was l05 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx an extensive evaluation including in xxxNAMExxx testing and flow cytometry of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
Because of the ongoing nature of his xxxPEOPLExxx He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work up revealed that he had nearly normal xxxPEOPLExxx of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of xxxxSUSPICIOUS_NUM2xxxx .
His anti cardio lipen antibodies xxxPEOPLExxx IGM and IGG were within normal range .
His APC resistance was normal .
Rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small xxxNAMExxx coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work up was undertaken .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
Because of the persistent nature of his xxxPEOPLExxx and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest xxxPEOPLExxx syndrome .
That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .
That was performed in the xxxPEOPLExxx clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .
After extended discussions with xxxPEOPLExxx service , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> was brought back down to the xxxPEOPLExxx clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> .
There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .
Therefore , on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aalv Sctroi</PHI> .

The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/93 vxxxPEOPLExxx xxxPEOPLExxx femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .
are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .
Is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .
EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .
The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient &apos;s procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .
The patient remained intubated postoperatively .
She had a xxxPEOPLExxx xxxPEOPLExxx postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .
The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung xxxPEOPLExxx Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium xxxPEOPLExxx and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and xxxxADDRESS8xxxx patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at xxxPEOPLExxx greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .
She was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .
The patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .
She was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .
Is satisfactory .
During this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .
