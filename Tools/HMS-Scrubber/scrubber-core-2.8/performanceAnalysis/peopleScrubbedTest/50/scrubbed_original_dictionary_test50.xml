DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Gait ataxia .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
WORK DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :
A peripheral neuropathy was xxxPEOPLExxx diagnosed in xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx , cause undetermined .
Thoracic and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging study were normal .
The present admission was prompted by an episode of inability to walk at all for the past two or xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx 
A computerized tomography scan done in the emergency room showed enlarged ventricles , suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus .
Pulse 72 and regular .
Blood pressure 154 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was no aphasia .
He was unable to get up from the bed without help .
He swayed backward on the Romberg test .
Cranial nerves otherwise normal .
Plantars withal , possibly bilaterally extensor .
Mild decreased vibration and position sense in the toes .
Pin prick sensation decreased below the ankles .
Routine laboratory studies were negative .
The computerized tomography scan showed the findings described above .
A therapeutic lumbar puncture was planned on the day after emergency admission , but his gait was noted to be considerably improved at that time , and the lumbar puncture was postponed until <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , at which time 40 cc were removed .
There was slight further improvement of gait , mainly xxxPEOPLExxx unsteadiness , but no change in speed .
The gait was essentially what it had been before the episode of worsening prior to admission , moderate ataxia , slight flexed posture , very slight shuffling .
It was felt that this response and the presentation raised a definite question of symptomatic normal pressure hydrocephalus , but that this could not be diagnosed definitely at this time .
It was decided to continue to follow Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fyfeshuff</PHI> on an outpatient basis , with a follow up appointment in xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx

PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light headedness for xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; .
She states this light headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea .
She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally .
She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds .

Labs on admission :
Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper trophy with xxxPEOPLExxx anterior progression of R waves .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
She was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the xxxPEOPLExxx coronary artery .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxADDRESS7xxxx  xxxNAMExxx valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and xxxPEOPLExxx carotid endarterectomy .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .
She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-04</PHI>-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-05</PHI>-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later .
However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-07</PHI>-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted xxxPEOPLExxx upper and xxxPEOPLExxx lower extremity discoordination .
She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long term for her aortic valve replacement .
She is transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Rockdempbanri Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-28</PHI>-92 to continue her rehabilitation .
Discharge medications :
Upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .

However , her EKG &apos;s did progress to T wave inversions in V1-V6 , and it was felt that the patient most likely had at some point had a myocardial infarction .
The patient was started on Ecotrin and a beta blocker as well as Isordil and Diltiazem for the possibility of 5-FU induced vasal spasm .
Just prior to discharge , she underwent an exercise tolerance test with a modified xxxNAMExxx protocol where she went seven minutes and seventeen seconds , and stopped secondary to fatigue .
She did not have any chest pain or EKG changes , however , hermaximal heart rate was 71 , and her blood pressure was 110 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was felt by the cardiologist on the case that this was more exercise than she usually did at xxxPEOPLExxx and she was comfortable with the current medical regimen .

DIABETES ADULT ONSET .
GUAIAC POSITIVE .
The patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx , who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tlowepeh Hospital</PHI> after an anterolateral MI , with post MI stuttering chest pain .
He has no history of hypertension or family history .
Since then , he has had rare angina over the past year , and has been able to walk his dog one mile a day with occasional mild left sided chest pain that is always relived by a brief rest .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/90 , he had a parietal headache at 8:00 a.m. that was followed promptly by left sided chest pain without diaphoresis , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , or palpitations which lasted for an hour with awaxing and waning course .
His EKG showed an intraventricular conduction delay with anterolateral ST depressions and T waves inversions .
He was ruled in for a non Q wave MI with peak CKs of 531 , positive for MB .
This course was complicated by a transient left bundle branch block on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> , atrial fibrillation despite his Quinidine .
Quinidine level on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> was 1 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx had mild CHF , which was treated with Captopril and prn Lasix .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Norri Hospital</PHI> for evaluation of his post MI angina .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Status post cholecystectomy , status post xxxPEOPLExxx inguinal herniorrhaphy .
ALLERGIES :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was pain free and resting comfortably .
His neck showed a left sided carotid which was 2+ without bruit , and a xxxPEOPLExxx sided carotid which was 1+ without bruit .
His xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx examination had bilateral basilar rales greater on the xxxPEOPLExxx than the left .
Guaiac positive .
Pulses :
2+ femoral without bruit , 1+ dorsalis pedis on the left , trace dorsalis pedis on the xxxPEOPLExxx and trace posterior tibial bilaterally .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hemoglobin was 10.7 white cell count was 8.2 , platelets 211 , PT and PTT were xxxxDATE12xxxx 6 , Quinidine was 2.5 , and CKA was xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was pain free with EKG ST depressions laterally .
Around 4:00 p.m. this occurred and he was given a beta blocker 2.5 mg IV push times four .
His heart rate went down to xxxxADDRESS8xxxx this time , he was also given 25 mg xxxPEOPLExxx of Lopressor .
He complained of continued nausea and vomiting .
He had a good urinary output .
On the above chest x xxxPEOPLExxx no evidence of dissection was noted .
Atropine X 2 amps were given and the heart rate was in the 60s with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 to 90 range by Doppler .
Oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .
The patient was intubated and prior to intubation his rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .
Surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra aortic balloon pump .
Central access was gained and a chest x xxxPEOPLExxx was done which showed no pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as xxxPEOPLExxx tube .
He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .
Atropine one amp was given .
At this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .
The family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .

ALLERGIES :
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Lasix 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
He had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .
An intra aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .
Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection xxxPEOPLExxx of 40% , by gated cardiac blood xxxPEOPLExxx scanning .
He returned for routine office evaluation on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/93 , complaining of xxxxAGE6xxxx of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .
Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .
The carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .
His chest X xxxPEOPLExxx demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , xxxPEOPLExxx greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re distribution .
The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with xxxPEOPLExxx degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non specific ST T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine xxxxDATE22xxxx 7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .
Over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 xxxxDATE22xxxx lbs .
Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .
At the time of this study , the xxxPEOPLExxx atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure xxxxDATE22xxxx , and the mean pulmonary capillary xxxPEOPLExxx pressure was xxxxADDRESS8xxxx ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .
There was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior xxxNAMExxx aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .
The aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .
A dominant xxxPEOPLExxx coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .
A large xxxPEOPLExxx ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .
The posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .
The saphenous vein graft to the xxxPEOPLExxx ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
These findings were reviewed with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Patella</PHI> and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate xxxPEOPLExxx choice in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> &apos;s management .
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .
It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .
He is looking forward to returning xxxPEOPLExxx and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .
We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wierst</PHI> and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .

There was xxxPEOPLExxx effect and some midline shift .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to then Neurologic Intensive Care Unit .
On admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was a large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .
There was no enhancement xxxPEOPLExxx in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .
This was followed up with a bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .
The GI Service was consulted on this xxxPEOPLExxx and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .
This confirmed an 8 mm. xxxPEOPLExxx which was bright on T2 and homogeneous in the xxxPEOPLExxx lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with a benign hemangioma or cyst .
The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the xxxPEOPLExxx side and ability to walk with assistance .

<PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/93 - mitral valve replacement and replacement of ascending aorta .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
There were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
There was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
She was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .
She was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .
She had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI> , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .
After considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .
It was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .
Her valve was replaced with a St. xxxNAMExxx Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
In the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .
The sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .
Her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .
With clotting xxxPEOPLExxx replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .
She remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .
Autopsy permission was granted .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient is an xxxxAGE5xxxx with a history of dementia , and of a choreoathetotic movement disorder of unclear etiology .
W / U for xxxxPRIVATExxx &apos;s , ceruloplasmin , TSH , etc have all been negative in the past .
Patient was admitted to neurology service .
Infact , this medication was found to cause a significant improvement in her choreoathetotic perioral and arm movements .
She still has significant myoclonic component in her arms especially with volition , but this med will certainly be continued .
While essentially what we ARE hoping for in this use of the med is extra pyramidal side effects , she should be monitored for any excessive or debilitating parkinsonian symptoms such as excessive rigidity .

She was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Aper Hospital</PHI> for change in mental status on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
Initial work up was unrevealing .
She was discharged to rehabilitation and developed disorientation , confusion , incoordination , and apparent paranoia .
Throughout her admission , she experienced occasional low grade temperatures to 99 Fahrenheit with persistent leukocytosis .
There was a reported examination of her peritoneal fluid when fluid was being drawn for culture .
A catheter was subsequently placed for treatment of __________ for xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx of ceftazidime .
Herperitoneal fluid cultures have all been negative and showed only 3 polys .
There was a question of 3 x 4 collection around the peritoneal catheter that was investigated with an I+ abdominal CT scan that was not conclusive .
She was switched , however , to hemodialysis from peritoneal dialysis .
Work up also included a negative PPD , Clostridium difficile toxin , blood cultures , and head CT scan .
A Speech and Swallow evaluation initially deemed her an aspiration risk , and she was taken of xxxPEOPLExxx &apos;s .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for end stage renal disease secondary to chronic urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis with vesicoureteral reflux .
And status post xxxPEOPLExxx nephrectomy , status post cholecystectomy , ____________thyroidectomy .

Include SULFA , CODEINE , TETRACYCLINE , NITROFURANTOIN .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She denies the use of tobacco or ethanol .
FAMILY HISTORY :
The patient was afebrile at 98.7 , blood pressure 128/64 , heart rate 96 , respiratory rate 22 , xxxxADDRESS8xxxx  on room air .
The oropharynx was moist .
The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm .
There was no palpable lymphadenopathy .
The chest was clear bilaterally .
The heart had a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no erythema around the catheter site .

LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes .
The electroencephalogram showed left greater than xxxPEOPLExxx frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .
As noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative Clostridium difficile , a weakly positive D dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx up included from a neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .
In concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .
An lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .
For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .
For her FEN , the patient was able to take xxxPEOPLExxx &apos;s and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take xxxPEOPLExxx &apos;s with one to one supervision .
From an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .
Excellent suggestions from Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Pa</PHI> of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient &apos;s weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .
However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .
CA-125 xxxPEOPLExxx were within normal limits .
We entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .
We will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .
Pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementxxxPEOPLExxxnd will likely discharge the patient to return to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Termarimed</PHI> pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx who has had a xxxxPRIVATExxx mitral valve replacement on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS7xxxx  <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Melvean Ace</PHI> .
In xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Times</PHI> , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .
She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .
A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .
Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was on diltiazem and digoxin .
At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .
Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .
Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .
She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to xxxxADDRESS8xxxx , a temporary pacemaker that put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI> , and diltiazem was restarted .
It showed that she had a large big xxxPEOPLExxx dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .
The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .
The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation xxxPEOPLExxx on left ventricular angiogram .
This was an Intermedex xxxxACCESSION_KPxxxx pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx will ambulate her over the next couple of days .
We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite xxxPEOPLExxx If she remains xxxPEOPLExxx over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">xxxPEOPLExxx</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Em Neighburce</PHI> .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is alert and oriented and has a sling for his left humeral fracture .
Mild xxxPEOPLExxx facial droop .
Sensation intact .
Chest / lungs :
Abdomen distended , mild tenderness on the left , bowel sounds present , nohepatosplenomegaly .
No calf tenderness .
Guaiac negative .
LABORATORY DATA :
Elevated left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology or duration .
The patient also had a shoulder film done on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/97 that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .
A lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also xxxPEOPLExxx and a CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
EKG :
T - waves were also noted to be inverted in I and AVL .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did xxxPEOPLExxx out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than xxxxADDRESS8xxxx his procedure on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/97 to <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/97 , and the xxxPEOPLExxx level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was consulted on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible xxxNAMExxx xxxNAMExxx tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to xxxPEOPLExxx out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow up appointment inapproximately xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx 
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fordwoodall Stick</PHI> , in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , xxxxPRIVATExxx xxxxSUSPICIOUS_NUMxxxx PHI> .

The patient &apos;s admitting chest x xxxPEOPLExxx showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
6. ENDOCRINE :

A KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and xxxPEOPLExxx bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 25</PHI> where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre renal azotemia .
A urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .
A head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the xxxPEOPLExxx frontal and cerebellar lobes .
There was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient &apos;s diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .

After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .
The patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over xxxxADDRESS8xxxx ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .
However , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg xxxPEOPLExxx q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate xxxPEOPLExxx intake to maintain her volume status .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter felt that it was likely that her xxxPEOPLExxx intake would improve when she returned xxxPEOPLExxx to the nursing xxxPEOPLExxx I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her xxxPEOPLExxx intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .
The patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .
Nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing xxxPEOPLExxx I will get in touch with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Areas</PHI> and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
dehydration .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
dementia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx with a history of psychotic depression with paranoia who presents status post a few days of incontinence , increased confusion , and collapse .
The patient who has a baseline mental status / psychiatric impairment was reported to be increasingly confused and paranoid over the past few days .
Her xxxPEOPLExxx intake has also decreased .
The head computerized tomography scan on admission to the emergency room revealed moderate to severe cortical atrophy without evidence of acute bleed or subdural hemorrhage .
She does have paranoid features .
The patient has a history of near syncope in xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx and also a history of dehydration .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with elderly siblings .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Elderly obese woman lying comfortably in bed in no acute distress .
The lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally .
regular rate and rhythm with normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
revealed one plus edema bilaterally .
She answers inappropriately to questions .
revealed sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 26.4 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose was xxxxADDRESS8xxxx amylase was xxxxADDRESS8xxxx complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 11,900 ; hematocrit of 38 and platelet count of 207,000 ; the tox screen was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Dehydration .
The patient was mildly dehydrated at time of admission and was replaced with intravenous fluids until she began taking good xxxPEOPLExxx intake .
2. Infectious Disease .
Therefore the patient was started on Bactrim for urinary tract infection .
She did not tolerate oral medication initially and was switched to intravenous ampicillin .
The antibiotics were discontinued after xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx of intravenous antibiotic therapy .
A repeat urinalysis done later in the course of the hospitalization revealed no white blood cells .
The patient underwent neuropsychiatric testing .
Conclusion was that this was a dementing process .
The testing was performed by a staff neuropsychologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lornsook Trusmoag</PHI> , PhD , telephone number <PHI TYPE="PHONE xxxxTELEPHONE3xxxx PHI> .
Approximately xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx into the hospital stay it was noted that the patient had significant xxxPEOPLExxx parotid swelling .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so a contrast study was not available .
The patient was evaluated by ENT who felt that her enlargement was more likely secondary to an inflammatory process although they could not xxxPEOPLExxx out malignancy .
It was felt that attempting a biopsy and beginning antibiotic treatment was not indicated at this time as the xxxPEOPLExxx had entirely resolved .
The ENT physician who saw the patient is Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freieslowkays</PHI> .
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freieslowkays</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx at 1:20 p.m. at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- xxxNAMExxx xxxHOSPITALxxx Hospital</PHI> .

However , she has been reluctant to even move from the bed to the chair since admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph xxxxPRIVATExxx Of Medical Center</PHI> .
Physical Therapy has been working with her .
Fear of falling seems to be a large component of this , and the patient will likely need considerable patience in convincing her it is okay to get out of bed again .

4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x xxxPEOPLExxx other than a xxxPEOPLExxx lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .
The chest x xxxPEOPLExxx cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x xxxPEOPLExxx However , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total xxxxAGE6xxxx course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .
No organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .
It was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .

SUMMARY PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
This is a xxxxAGE5xxxx gentleman with a past medical history of gastric lymphoma status post total gastrectomy / splenectomy in xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx with a Roux en-Y reconstruction .
He had a normal bowel movement the day prior to admission .
History of small bowel obstruction in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> , pancytopenia , history of xxxPEOPLExxx renal calculus .
Splenectomy , total gastrectomy as above , for gastric lymphoma for which he also received chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :

ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
PHYSICAL EXAM :
ABDOMEN :
No hernias .
The patient did have xxxPEOPLExxx costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted after placement of a nasogastric tube and was brought emergently to the operating room after a CT scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .
There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .
This was taken down and the Roux en-Y anastomosis was re sited proximally .
There was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .
However by the mid morning of the <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE16xxxx /PHI> , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .
The patient was invasively lined with a Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .
However prior to this it was also noted that the patient &apos;s scrotum was necrotic .
The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .
Upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic like picture and was maintained on Neo Synephrine .
It should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have a pancreatitis by enzymes .
This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .
The patient &apos;s urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .
therefore the patient went back to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .
The patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/00 the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .

The patient underwent <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital</PHI> multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .
She tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .
This was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .
She received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .
2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained xxxPEOPLExxx at this point .
Work up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .
Haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal LDH .
This was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and xxxPEOPLExxx hydration .
Patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .
A clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .
She did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .
Patient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> , and the <PHI TYPE="DATE">Septemberth of xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx PHI> to assure that her hematocrit recovers .
3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet xxxPEOPLExxx b.i.d.
Subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .
Patient received a xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .

2) PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION .
3) CORD COMPRESSION .
6) POOR NUTRITIONAL STATUS .
8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a xxxxAGE5xxxx white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 to <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/94 .
About xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the xxxPEOPLExxx lower ribs .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/94 of the spine showed a xxxPEOPLExxx posterior lateral epidural xxxPEOPLExxx extending from T9 to T12 .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Petersly Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> .
However  xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx prior to admission the patient developed xxxPEOPLExxx lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s xxxPEOPLExxx lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the xxxPEOPLExxx lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , xxxPEOPLExxx pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
1) Multiple myeloma .
3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .
5) Chronically low platelet count .
6) Failed autologous bone marrow transplant in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx  Hypothyroidism .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Married to a very supportive wife .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS :
HEENT exam atraumatic , no oral lesions .
Neck supple , carotids without bruits .
Abdomen non distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
Rectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .
Motor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .
Coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count xxxxADDRESS8xxxx 1 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx x xxxPEOPLExxx was without infiltrates , wand in good position .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural xxxPEOPLExxx at the xxxPEOPLExxx posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
In addition , the patient received a xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral xxxPEOPLExxx lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection xxxPEOPLExxx when he is clinically better .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
His neurological exam remained xxxPEOPLExxx with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a xxxPEOPLExxx nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
Both of these responded to xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

An electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased ST segment and left anterior ST depressions .
RV leads were negative for ST elevation .
A chest x xxxPEOPLExxx showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .
A portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded xxxPEOPLExxx coronary artery .
The patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .
He was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on Dobutamine for pressure support .
He was diuresed with Lasix and Diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated .
Two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with xxxPEOPLExxx blood pressure on a very small amount of Dobutamine .
Discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities .
They were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction .
An echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both xxxPEOPLExxx or left ventriculus .
The family and the attending physician were notified .

The review of systems was negative .
The patient was admitted to the hospital on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-8</PHI>-94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the <PHI TYPE="ID">EXWAGH9T</PHI> protocol .
During this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .
An X xxxPEOPLExxx at the time revealed free air .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
At the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take down .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .
A Holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .
The patient was xxxPEOPLExxx in consultation and evaluated by Cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , Propanolol , and verapamil .
Again , he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .

DISCHARGE DATE :
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gastric ulcer and gastric pericardial fistula , constricting pericarditis , adult respiratory distress syndrome , status post gunshot wounds and paraplegia since xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx of T4 on down .
The patient has a xxxNAMExxx filter in .
He had a gastric pull up in xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx of the stomach into the left thorax and he has a transverse colostomy and a sinus tract on the abdomen .

Lasix prn .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a pericardial window .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Reg Cranka</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Win Shufffyfe</PHI> .
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx that showed abnormal xxxPEOPLExxx ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection xxxPEOPLExxx of 64% .
There is trace pulmonary insufficiency .
The xxxPEOPLExxx ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was xxxPEOPLExxx on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
A copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
The patient is approximately xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge .
3. GI :
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy .
The patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
There is no fistula xxxPEOPLExxx Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">xxxPEOPLExxx</PHI> of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
He just claims to have no appetite and has very xxxPEOPLExxx effort with feeding .
It has been noted to be improving .
The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes .
The patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti .
These wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings .
The patient remains on Fluconazole .
His most recent cultures are negative .
The chest X xxxPEOPLExxx shows no evidence of pneumonia .
The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued .
Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
Senokot two tablets xxxPEOPLExxx bid or Metamucil one tablespoon xxxPEOPLExxx bid .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> is a xxxxAGE5xxxx gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , alcoholic cirrhosis , and rectal cancer , who was scheduled for a resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the xxxPEOPLExxx team for improvement of his heart failure .
He has a long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy , presumably due to alcohol .
He has also had atrial fibrillation since xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx , which has been rate controlled on Digoxin .

Digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day .
His temperature was xxxxADDRESS8xxxx pressure was 104 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx saturation was 97% on room air .
His heart rate was irregularly with a xxxxDATE22xxxx holosystolic murmur .
His chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one halfway up the chest .
After aggressive diuresis on the Medical Service , he was deemed xxxPEOPLExxx for surgery .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .
His fluids were very strongly restricted , and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the Operating xxxxROOMxxxx cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated .
He continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator .
He required some fluid boluses with D xxxxAGExxxx to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance .
His respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently .
At that time , multiple discussions were held with the family , and they decided to enact a Do Not Resuscitate order .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> &apos;s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine .
A Swan Ganz catheter revealed an SVR of 350 , and he was started on Neo Synephrine and Epinephrine prior to the Do Not Resuscitate order .
He had no carotid pulses , no gag reflex , and no pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .
The family was contacted and were present at his bedside .
A postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">PUOMC</PHI> admissions for this xxxxAGE5xxxx with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .
She ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain .
There had been no focal neurologic changes .
On admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on xxxxROOMxxxx  .
She did look mildly dyspneic .
She was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .
Sodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx ALT 11 , her AST slightly up at xxxxADDRESS8xxxx 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets 345 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx CA 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .
She had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the xxxPEOPLExxx few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of Physical Therapy .
Her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .
The sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION , PULMONARY LYMPHANGITIC SPREAD , AND LIVER AND SPLEEN METASTASES .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx gravida IV , xxxPEOPLExxx 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo oophorectomy and appendectomy .
EKG showed sinus tachycardxxxPEOPLExxxt 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .
As above .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and xxxxROOMxxxx saturation was 93% .
Dry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .
NECK :
No lymphadenopathy .
CHEST :
Few inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi .
HEART :
ABDOMEN :
Well healed xxxNAMExxx scars and no masses .
PELVIC :
No masses .
No masses and guaiac negative .
No edema or cyanosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx and PTT were 12 and xxxxADDRESS8xxxx COURSE :
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was no evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
She should have a follow up echocardiogram .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> and Ifex and Mesna on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Granrivern Call</PHI> is a xxxxAGE5xxxx xxxPEOPLExxx handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at xxxPEOPLExxx His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
Over the five to xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth xxxPEOPLExxx and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
There was no known incontinence .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Coumadin 4 mgs xxxPEOPLExxx qhs , Vasotec 5 mgs xxxPEOPLExxx qd , Lasix prn , Digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , Proscar and Sinemet .
ALLERGIES :
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) atrial fibrillation on coumadin ,
3) Question progressive supranuclear palsy .
5) hypertension .
He lives with his wife who is his primary care giver .
He is a former professor at <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</PHI> .
Alcohol ; he has no recent use .
He has a father who had dementia .
head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .
His neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits .
Cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
Neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice .
His pupils were three down to two on the xxxPEOPLExxx and five down to four on the left .
According to the family this iansicoria was old .
He had left greater than xxxPEOPLExxx nasal stimulation to grimace .
He triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain .
His deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the xxxPEOPLExxx brachial radialis and xxxPEOPLExxx patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were xxxxADDRESS8xxxx toes were down going .
SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
chest x xxxPEOPLExxx clear .
There was also evidence of an old xxxPEOPLExxx frontal infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency xxxxROOMxxxx mgs of intravenous Ativan which did xxxPEOPLExxx to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re evaluated in xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx time once the hematoma is xxxPEOPLExxx prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti coagulation .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph xxxxPRIVATExxx Of Medical Center</PHI> and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision . xxxNAMExxx his nasogastric tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ria</PHI> in clinic on xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .

4. Transplant nephrectomy .
5. Pulmonary emboli .
7. Coronary artery disease .
9. Hypercoagulable state .
10. Perforated viscus .
12. Sepsis .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
A pulmonary arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely xxxPEOPLExxx than xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS7xxxx without evidence of perforation .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five xxxNAMExxx xxxNAMExxx drains into the retroperitoneal xxxPEOPLExxx cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Less</PHI> continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his xxxNAMExxx xxxNAMExxx site and xxxPEOPLExxx oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Less</PHI> condition was irretrievable .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/98 .

The patient was tachycardiac on admission and it was felt she was dehydrated and / or anxious at the time of her initial evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent chemotherapy on the following doses :
IFEX 1.2 grams per meter squared x xxxxAGE6xxxx , MESNA 1.2 grams per meter squared x xxxxAGE6xxxx continuous IV infusion .
She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient &apos;s urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .
A repeat straight cath was negative for RBC&apos;s .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
The patient was counselled and received 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s at that time .
At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was restarted on Coumadin 2.5 mg per day .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a xxxxAGE5xxxx patient of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Laymie Fournier</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leebjescobe</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Co In Saorlirv Frea , xxxxPRIVATExxx</PHI> who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx , at which time he was hospitalized at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center</PHI> .
He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .
A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He was started on aspirin .
He has a family history of hypertension as well .
He was also placed on Vasotec .
A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
unremarkable .
Carotids normal .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Nonfocal .
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose xxxxADDRESS8xxxx 197 , triglycerides 118 , HDL 31 , LDL 142 , total protein 6.2 , bilirubin 1.0 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , SGOT xxxxADDRESS8xxxx patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary xxxPEOPLExxx pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He developed epigastric pain on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .
The patient was xxxPEOPLExxx in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Slusslashgodle</PHI> , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the xxxPEOPLExxx coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .
His intra aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He was xxxPEOPLExxx in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection xxxPEOPLExxx but he is clinically xxxPEOPLExxx on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged xxxPEOPLExxx He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew</PHI> .

Revealed a sodium 136 , potassium 4.5 , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 , glucose 136. hematocrit 40% .
chest x xxxPEOPLExxx revealed prominent pulmonary xxxPEOPLExxx and enlarged heart .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed .
Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy .
Despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated .
Upon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and CPR was being performed .
The rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure .
There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions .
A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure .
In total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate .
The resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 AM and were begun at 3:38 AM .

Patient also received AICD .
Patient &apos;s past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">07</PHI>/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .
In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .
Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a xxxPEOPLExxx of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx , due to the patient &apos;s long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .
The patient did well at xxxPEOPLExxx until <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/94 when she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Souland</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nixmont Bovo</PHI> with increasing congestive heart failure .
At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .
She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .
She was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/94 , again for possible heart lung transplantation .
The patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .
It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was xxxPEOPLExxx by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Alllo Eino Hospital</PHI> which recommended EPS to xxxPEOPLExxx out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient &apos;s arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the xxxPEOPLExxx 24 hours of the patient &apos;s hospitalization without difficulty .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/94 an EPS study was performed .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx , biopsies from the xxxPEOPLExxx forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .
There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .
At this point it was felt the patient would go xxxPEOPLExxx on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .

He subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx which was negative for ischemia or infarction .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .
He was diagnosed with xxxNAMExxx Parkinson White Syndrome .
He underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Slusslashgodle</PHI> which were unsuccessful .
He was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI>/98 he was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay xxxHOSPITALxxx Hospital Of</PHI> with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .
He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .
He was discharged xxxPEOPLExxx but returned on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .
Sotalol 160 mg bid .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
NPH and CZI insulin .
ALLERGIES :
He reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .
There was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .
However , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .
There was a grade xxxxDATE22xxxx holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .
His abdomen was benign .
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
He was xxxPEOPLExxx by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nnoatal Hospital Center</PHI> who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .
His xxxPEOPLExxx coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to xxxPEOPLExxx collaterals .
His left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .
Mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .
There were no complications .
Following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .
In following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to xxxxADDRESS8xxxx were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx also underwent a post procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection xxxPEOPLExxx of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .
Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .
Accordingly he was xxxPEOPLExxx by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .
He did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .
Given his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He will have a visiting nurse to see him on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Iat</PHI> .
Sotalol 120 mg bid .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
Oxybutynin 5 mg qd .

Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
A repeat CMV hypercapture , negative for presence of CMV .
A repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .
Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .
Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> of a new xxxPEOPLExxx sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the xxxPEOPLExxx occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the xxxPEOPLExxx cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .
A single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x xxxPEOPLExxx on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .
Patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is an xxxxAGE5xxxx white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection .
Of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .
He recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .
There was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter , however , works at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> and therefore the family elected to bring the patient xxxPEOPLExxx and then bring her to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> .
She presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .
ENT examination was then to be performed .
Chest x xxxPEOPLExxx showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
Smoking none .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Oral cavity was normal .
Revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant xxxPEOPLExxx Neck :
The xxxPEOPLExxx pyriform was narrowed by edema .
The epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .
The patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .
There was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .
Lungs :
Clear .
Heart :
Regular rate and rhythm .
S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .
Extremities :
Normal .
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
Due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .
The patient was sedated .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct xxxPEOPLExxx or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. xxxxADDRESS7xxxx down to the Operating Room .
Her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
She continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .
Her blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .
She was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .
She continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .
Her edema decreased over the next xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx and repeat fiberoptic examination on both <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI> revealed decreasing edema .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE" xxxxDATE22xxxx /PHI>/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .
She was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .
Examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .
Of note , during her xxxPEOPLExxx hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .
Tube feedings were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE22xxxx PHI>/91 and the xxxPEOPLExxx tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE" xxxxDATE22xxxx /PHI>/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .
Again , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
It was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .
She was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .
She was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .
She had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .
Nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .
DISPOSITION :
She , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
If she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .
The patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx

In <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx patient developed 2 xxxxAGE6xxxx of headaches , cognitive changes , dizziness and memory loss .
An MRI showed enhancing white marrow lesions at the bifrontal lobes on the xxxPEOPLExxx side , and rightsided basal ganglion in the xxxPEOPLExxx cerebral peduncle .
The patient was initially treated with high dose methotrexate for six cycles .
However , the patient developed left IIIrd nerve palsy and an MRI showed increasing lesion in the left ______________ cerebral peduncle and the left mid brain .
On the high dose ARA C chemotherapy , the patient developed bone marrow suppression requiring intermittent Neupogen ( GCSF ) support .
The patient was recently discharged from the hospital after her second cycle of high dose ARA C chemotherapy .
On the day of admission the patient &apos;s platelet count dropped to 28,000 and the patient was admitted for her platelet transfusions and further work up for her rectal bleeding .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE21xxxx PHI>/95 :
white blood count 5,000 , hematocrit 38 , platelet count 50 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx polys , 8 bands with ANC of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx 136 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 103 , bicarb 26 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx patient developed substernal chest pain without radiation on the night of admission .
An electrocardiogram showed flat ST change in lead III , otherwise unremarkable and the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin without symptomatic improvement .
The patient was given 2 units of packed RBC along with the six units of platelet transfusion .
The patient &apos;s symptoms improved with the above measures and the patient no longer complained of chest pain during the hospitalization .
The patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 76,000 on the following morning ; however , her white blood count dropped to 900 with 58 polys with 8 bands .
Because of significant neutropenia , the patient was put on reverse isolation and started on GCSF injections .
A GI consultation was made and they felt that the rectal bleeding is most likely from the hemorrhoids and no further intervention was felt to be necessary .
After the transfusion the patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 101,000 on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> .
The patient had a follow up MRI scan which showed no significant change of tumor xxxPEOPLExxx However , in lieu of a persistent bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy , it was decided that she should undergo radiation therapy .

ADMISSION DATE :
3. insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
4. malignant xxxPEOPLExxx pleural effusion .
5. atrial flutter .
6. gastrointestinal bleeding .
7. cerebrovascular accident .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
She presented with wide complex tachycardxxxPEOPLExxxnd congestive heart failure .
She eventually ruled in for a myocardial infarction and was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , she was an elderly female in moderate respiratory distress , blood pressure 100/60 , respirations 26 , pulse 68 , temperature afebrile .
Her jugular venous pressure was within normal limits .
Arterial pulse contours were diminished bilaterally .
S1 and S2 were markedly diminished .
A soft systolic ejection murmur was audible at the base .
A soft Grade I II / VI holosystolic murmur was evident at the apex .
No S3 was present .
Breath sounds were markedly diminished on the xxxPEOPLExxx crackles were present on the left , approximately xxxxDATE22xxxx up .
The lower extremity pulses were diminished .
There was 2+ lower extremity edema evident .
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Crestwall Hospital</PHI> , where a therapeutic thoracentesis was performed in order to alleviate her dyspnea .
Cytology was positive for moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma .
A cardiac ultrasound study on <PHI TYPE="DATE" xxxHOSPITALxxx Day</PHI> demonstrated an aortic stenosis with a calculated valve area of  xxxxADDRESS7xxxx cm .
An enhancing focus in the left thalamus was thought to represent a subacute infarct .
In addition an old cerebellar focal infarct was noted , although metastasis could not be completely excluded .
After extensive consultation with her family and with the patient herself , it was decided that her status should be made DNR .
Over the weekend of <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI> , her condition further deteriorated , and she was started on a morphine drip .
We insured that she was comfortable until she expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/94 .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cean Leach</PHI> is a xxxxAGE5xxxx who is admitted in transfer from the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ville , Virginia</PHI> for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .
A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .
His ejection xxxPEOPLExxx was in the mid-50&apos;s.
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
He did well until he developed recurrent angina in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> of xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .
Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with recurrent chest pain .
He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection xxxPEOPLExxx as measured by non invasive means with an echo ejection xxxPEOPLExxx in the low 40&apos;s and radionuclide ejection xxxPEOPLExxx estimated in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> of xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx at 31% .
He was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with a typical episode of this discomfort in <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> of xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
He was transferred at that time to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph xxxxPRIVATExxx Of Medical Center</PHI> .
That was his xxxPEOPLExxx <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph xxxxPRIVATExxx Of Medical Center</PHI> admission .
Because of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .
He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
There he had a xxxPEOPLExxx heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .
Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant xxxPEOPLExxx coronary artery or his left coronary system .
However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .
It was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .
Starting in the <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> of xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .
He had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and xxxPEOPLExxx in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .
His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .
There is no history of drug abuse or smoking .
Of note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He looked generally well .
His heart rate was xxxxADDRESS8xxxx abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .
His femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .
Potassium of 3 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .
His fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of xxxxADDRESS8xxxx liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to xxxxADDRESS8xxxx hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
the primary concern upon Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
The left ventricular pressure was l05 xxxxADDRESS8xxxx angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxMONTHxxxx PHI> of xxxxYEAR_CENTURYxxxx .
Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection xxxPEOPLExxx of 35% .
Impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .
He was ; therefore , xxxPEOPLExxx in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lato Tikfreierm</PHI> of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .
This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s regiment .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
Repeat in xxxNAMExxx testing of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .
While in the hospital , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .
These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .
There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .
Multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .
He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work up revealed that he had nearly normal xxxPEOPLExxx of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of xxxxSUSPICIOUS_NUM2xxxx .
Protein S was l14 with a reference range of xxxxSUSPICIOUS_NUM2xxxx .
Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 . xxxPEOPLExxx 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of xxxxSUSPICIOUS_NUM2xxxx .
Thrombin time and repalase time were normal .
It was felt that these results were non specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .
His anti cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .
His APC resistance was normal .
Rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small xxxNAMExxx coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work up was undertaken .
He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .
His compliment xxxPEOPLExxx were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .
To evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .
He was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
After extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .
Therefore , on <PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE7xxxx PHI> , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aalv Sctroi</PHI> .
He tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Ticlopodine 500 mg. p.o.b.i.d. Lovastatin 20 mg. p.o.q.d. Lasix 80 mg. q.d. Kayciel 60 meq b.i.d. Cimetidine 400 mg. b.i.d. Isordil 20 mg. t.i.d. and Lodopine 10 mg. q.d. a combination of Percocet , Morphine Sulfate elixir xxxPEOPLExxx as needed .

THORACOABDOMINAL ANEURYSM .
Unsigned
Report Status :
<PHI TYPE="DATE xxxxDATE4xxxx PHI>/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm .
HISTORY :
At that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">xxxPEOPLExxx</PHI> for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .
Since the patient &apos;s last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active .
Her head and neck examination is within normal limits .
Her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
She has a pulsatile upper abdominal xxxPEOPLExxx She has a well healed xxxPEOPLExxx groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient &apos;s procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .
She had a xxxPEOPLExxx xxxPEOPLExxx postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .
Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium xxxPEOPLExxx and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and xxxxADDRESS8xxxx patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at xxxPEOPLExxx greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
She was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .
Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .
Laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative xxxPEOPLExxx The epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing xxxxWRITTEN_AGE_1_TO_19xxxx aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .
Her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .
Social Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .
The patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .
She was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Is satisfactory .
(1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection .
During this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Lopressor 25 mg xxxPEOPLExxx b.i.d. , Dulcolax tablets 2 xxxPEOPLExxx q.a.m. , Dulcolax suppository 1 xxxPEOPLExxx q.o.d. , digoxin .125 mg xxxPEOPLExxx q. day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. , Tylenol 650 mg xxxPEOPLExxx PR q. 4 hours p.r.n. elevated temperature , Benadryl 25-50 xxxPEOPLExxx q.h.s. and Percocet 1-2 tablets xxxPEOPLExxx q. 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
The patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">xxxPEOPLExxx</PHI> and she is to maintain rehabilitation care at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Laelk xxxHOSPITALxxx Hospital</PHI> .
