MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION .
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
HISTORY OF CARDIOVASUCLAR ACCIDENT .
GUAIAC POSITIVE .
His coronary risks factors are prior MI , smoking until he quit more than forty years ago , and adult onset diabetes with question of increased cholesterol .
Since then , he has had rare angina over the past year , and has been able to walk his dog one mile a day with occasional mild left sided chest xxxPEOPLExxx that is always relived by a brief rest .
This course was complicated by a transient left bundle branch block on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/17</PHI> , atrial fibrillation despite his Quinidine .
Notable for coronary artery disease complicated by myocardial infarction and ventricular ectopic arrhythmia in 1960 , also a left sided CVA in 1960 , adult onset diabetes , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation of unknown duration , anemia which was consistent with iron deficiency , a left retinal hemorrhage status post laser treatment last year .
ALLERGIES :
Rectal :
Guaiac positive .
However , acutely at around 8:00 p.m. the systolic blood pressure plummeted down to 60 to 70 and at this time a chest x xxxPEOPLExxx was done which showed moderate CHF .
The patient complained of xxxPEOPLExxx between his shoulder blades and at this time IV fluid was increased , so was the Dopamine and Dobutamine .
He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .
At this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .
At this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was xxxPOSITIONxxx longer responsive .
The patient was without respirations or blood pressure .

Report Status :
There was a Grade I II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .
His chest X xxxPEOPLExxx demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , xxxPEOPLExxx greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re distribution .
Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .
Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 .
The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .
These findings were reviewed with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Patella</PHI> and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate xxxPEOPLExxx choice in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> &apos;s management .
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .
It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .

2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .
3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
At discharge after about two weeks post extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X xxxPEOPLExxx showed xxxPOSITIONxxx change .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/08</PHI>/91 , the patient called Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .

His chest X xxxPEOPLExxx showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir . xxxPOSITIONxxx other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
This was done on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/18</PHI>/91 .

In <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for xxxPEOPLExxx facial droop and left sided weakness .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
On arrival to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had xxxPOSITIONxxx appetite .
However , she denied any chest xxxPEOPLExxx dyspnea or syncope .
Her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and xxxPEOPLExxx bundle branch block .
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre renal azotemia .
A cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection xxxPEOPLExxx of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
Multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .

Conclusion was that this was a dementing process .
Approximately five days into the hospital stay it was noted that the patient had significant xxxPEOPLExxx parotid swelling .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so a contrast study was not available .
The patient was evaluated by ENT who felt that her enlargement was more likely secondary to an inflammatory process although they could not xxxPEOPLExxx out malignancy .
Cytology consult was called , but by the time the cytologist came to do a fine needle aspiration the xxxPEOPLExxx had shrunken to the point where there was nothing to aspirate .
It was felt that attempting a biopsy and beginning antibiotic treatment was not indicated at this time as the xxxPEOPLExxx had entirely resolved .

This is an 87 year old white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection .
She did not complain of significant xxxPEOPLExxx and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had xxxPOSITIONxxx true record of what was xxxPEOPLExxx Apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ez Ephtro Health Center</PHI> where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .
A lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
Chest x xxxPEOPLExxx showed significant kiphosis but otherwise xxxPOSITIONxxx significant lesions at all .
Negative .
Negative .
ALLERGIES :
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
She had xxxPOSITIONxxx respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
Her ear examination was normal .
The left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
Heart :
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
The patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
The patient was sedated .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and xxxPOSITIONxxx distinct xxxPEOPLExxx or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the xxxPEOPLExxx 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
She continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/5</PHI>/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had xxxPOSITIONxxx problems .
Again , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
She had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave xxxPOSITIONxxx an informal consult so that xxxPOSITIONxxx formal consult will be found in this chart .
Her mental status began to clear under the family &apos;s request .
She , of xxxPOSITIONxxx had xxxPOSITIONxxx history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
The patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .

In <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> 1994 , he had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography that shoed obstruction at the confluence of the left and xxxPEOPLExxx hepatic ducts .
Biopsies and fine needle aspirates were suspicious for recurrent cholangiocarcinoma .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His hematocrit was 25.8% , with a normal white blood cell count .
His bilirubin was total 11.1 , with a direct bilirubin of 10.2 and his alkaline phosphatase was 2,188 .
What then ensued was multiple attempts to insure adequate biliary decompression by use of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram and placement of biliary catheters and stents .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/95 and <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , very mild revisions were made of these and the feeling was that solution had been reached with good drainage .
He was feeling much better , taking good diet and denying xxxPEOPLExxx or fever .

<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cean Leach</PHI> is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ville , Virginia</PHI> for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .
A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .
He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection xxxPEOPLExxx as measured by non invasive means with an echo ejection xxxPEOPLExxx in the low 40&apos;s and radionuclide ejection xxxPEOPLExxx estimated in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l994 at 31% .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
Specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a xxxPEOPLExxx of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .
However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
Because of the refractory nature of his chest xxxPEOPLExxx and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">xxxPOSITIONxxx</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-9</PHI>-94 .
Of xxxPOSITIONxxx his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
There is xxxPOSITIONxxx other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
the primary concern upon Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
The xxxPEOPLExxx heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and xxxPEOPLExxx femoral vein revealed a mean xxxPEOPLExxx atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary xxxPEOPLExxx pressure of 12 mm of mercury .
While in the hospital , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> continued to nearly daily episodes of chest xxxPEOPLExxx Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .
His anti cardio lipen antibodies xxxPEOPLExxx IGM and IGG were within normal range .
He was xxxPEOPLExxx in consultation by xxxPEOPLExxx Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
He was then taken directly from the xxxPEOPLExxx clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
After extended discussions with xxxPEOPLExxx service , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> was brought back down to the xxxPEOPLExxx clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 27</PHI> .
He tolerated that procedure well and had xxxPOSITIONxxx recurrent anginal xxxPEOPLExxx throughout the rest of his hospitalization .

On physical examination she is a well developed female in xxxPOSITIONxxx distress .
Her head and neck examination is within normal limits .
She has a pulsatile upper abdominal xxxPEOPLExxx She has a well healed xxxPEOPLExxx groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .
EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .
The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient remained intubated postoperatively .
On postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .
The patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at xxxPEOPLExxx greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
Laboratory data obtained revealed xxxPOSITIONxxx significant changes from her initial postoperative xxxPEOPLExxx It was felt that the patient had been subjected significant xxxPEOPLExxx ischemxxxPEOPLExxxnd possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .
