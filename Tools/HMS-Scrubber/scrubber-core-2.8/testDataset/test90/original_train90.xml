DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Gait ataxia .
2. Communicating hydrocephalus .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES :
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Cimetidine 400 mg po b.i.d. ; aspirin 80 mg po q.d. ; Ventolin two puffs q.i.d. ;
WORK DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :
Permanent .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75-year-old right handed man with a past history of migraine , peripheral neuropathy , gait ataxia , and microvascular leukomalacia on magnetic resonance imaging study , was admitted because of an abrupt worsening of walking .
He had a history of progressive gait ataxia since 1989 , worsening over the past few months , and a recent decline in memory and concentration .
A peripheral neuropathy was first diagnosed in 1989 , cause undetermined .
Thoracic and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging study were normal .
Brain magnetic resonance imaging study showed atrophy and microvascular leukomalacia .
He had an episode of headache , flashing light , confusion and possible loss of consciousness in <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> , 1993 , at which time an magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain was unchanged and MRA was negative .
Memory , gait and occasional urinary incontinence worsened after that time .
The present admission was prompted by an episode of inability to walk at all for the past two or three days .
A computerized tomography scan done in the emergency room showed enlarged ventricles , suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pulse 72 and regular .
Blood pressure 154/90 .
He was alert and fully oriented , but had some trouble remembering current events and made one error in the Tom and Bill story after ten minutes .
He was unable to get up from the bed without help .
Gait was quite ataxic , with short steps , requiring support , but no freezing in place .
He swayed backward on the Romberg test .
Upward gaze was decreased .
Cranial nerves otherwise normal .
Slight left iliopsoas weakness .
Tendon reflex is absent .
Plantars withal , possibly bilaterally extensor .
No Hoffmann reflexes .
No frontal lobe release signs .
Coordination normal .
Mild decreased vibration and position sense in the toes .
Pin prick sensation decreased below the ankles .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Routine laboratory studies were negative .
The computerized tomography scan showed the findings described above .
A therapeutic lumbar puncture was planned on the day after emergency admission , but his gait was noted to be considerably improved at that time , and the lumbar puncture was postponed until <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 5</PHI> , at which time 40 cc were removed .
The cerebrospinal fluid was benign .
There was slight further improvement of gait , mainly less unsteadiness , but no change in speed .
The gait was essentially what it had been before the episode of worsening prior to admission , moderate ataxia , slight flexed posture , very slight shuffling .
It was felt that this response and the presentation raised a definite question of symptomatic normal pressure hydrocephalus , but that this could not be diagnosed definitely at this time .
It was decided to continue to follow Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fyfeshuff</PHI> on an outpatient basis , with a follow up appointment in one month .
If there is significant deterioration of gait , shunt treatment will be reconsidered .

2. Aortic stenosis .
3. Coronary artery disease .
PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the medicine service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04-29</PHI>-92 with a past history significant for aortic stenosis and chest pain who presented for evaluation for aortic valve replace-ment .
The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; .
She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea .
She denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest .
Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history .
Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-13</PHI>-92 , done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Otte A , New Jersey</PHI> and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 .
She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally .
She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension .
Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 .
HEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable .
Her neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur .
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected .
Extremi-ties :
There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable .
LAB / X-RAY DATA :
Labs on admission :
Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 .
EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Carotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery &quot; critical stenosis &quot; .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-01</PHI>-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy .
This was performed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Medicine</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Room</PHI> .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-04</PHI>-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .
There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-05</PHI>-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later .
However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-07</PHI>-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination .
She was begun on a heparin drip .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-9</PHI>-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia .
She underwent angiography on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-9</PHI>-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy .
She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-11</PHI>-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness .
She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .
She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement .
DISPOSITION :
She is transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Rockdempbanri Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-28</PHI>-92 to continue her rehabilitation .
Discharge medications :
Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Timoptic solution 0.5% OS b.i.d. ; Coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and Haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion .
Upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pain .
A cardiac catheterization in <PHI TYPE="DATE">07</PHI>/93 showed diffuse mid left anterior descending of 90% , 30% D1 and 70% circumflex .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room and tolerated the procedure well .
His intensive care unit stay was notable for intensive care unit psychosis which was treated with Haldol and Ativan .
He slowly resolved and became alert and oriented times three .
He had a psychiatry consult who agreed with the management .
His blood pressure control was somewhat difficult in the intensive care unit .
He received beta blockers both po and IV .
This caused him to become bradycardic down to the rate of 40 &apos;s .
It was felt that he was not a beta blocker candidate postoperatively .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE :
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 73 year old white female with a history of pancreatic cancer treated with 5-FU and a vague history of chest pain , admitted with EKG changes of unclear duration , consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1989 , she presented with painless jaundice , and a workup included pancreatic cancer .
She underwent a Whipple procedure and a cholecystectomy .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> of 1989 , she was begun on 5-FU for five days of treatment followed by three weeks of no treatment .
Since then , she has had occasional lower sternal chest pain when lying on her side , reproducible by palpation .
Two weeks prior to admission , she had a presyncopal episode but did not lose consciousness .
There were no other symptoms .
One day prior to admission , she was seen at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dagreat Health</PHI> for 5-FU , her third cycle .
She complained of chest pain and back pain , and an EKG was obtained which showed new Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , and T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , consistent with an anterior septal myocardial infarction .
She was reviewed by the cardiologists and was admitted for further evaluation of her myocardial infarction .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Include smoking and increased cholesterol .
There is no diabetes , hypertension , or family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes (1) pancreatic cancer , status post a Whipple procedure , on 5-FU .
(3) Fibrocystic breast disease .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Include 5-FU and Percocet for pain , Zantac , and Simethicone .
She has no known drug allergies .
She smoked up until ten years ago .
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is an elderly white female in no apparent distress with a temperature of 97.6 , blood pressure 122/70 , heart rate of 72 , and a respiratory rate of 20 .
Her physical examination is notable for an essentially entirely normal physical examination .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , includes a white blood cell count of 5.6 , hematocrit 37.4 , platelets 312 .
Her electrolytes were within normal limits .
The CK was 89 .
The urinalysis showed 5-10 white blood cells .
There were two red blood cells .
The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 75 , axis -30 degrees , Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , new in comparison to <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 1985 .
The chest x-ray showed a slightly increased cardiac size .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dagreat Health</PHI> Service where she ruled out for a myocardial infarction by CK &apos;s and LDH &apos;s .
However , her EKG &apos;s did progress to T-wave inversions in V1-V6 , and it was felt that the patient most likely had at some point had a myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram was done which showed apical septal akinesis , but with well preserved systolic function .
Her medicines could not be increased beyond low doses secondary to a low systolic blood pressure .
Just prior to discharge , she underwent an exercise tolerance test with a modified Bruce protocol where she went seven minutes and seventeen seconds , and stopped secondary to fatigue .
She did not have any chest pain or EKG changes , however , hermaximal heart rate was 71 , and her blood pressure was 110/60 .
It was felt by the cardiologist on the case that this was more exercise than she usually did at home , and she was comfortable with the current medical regimen .
PROBLEM # 2 :
PANCREATIC CANCER .
The patient will be continued on her 5-FU as an outpatient , to be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
Lumbosacral spines done during the admission did not show any change from x-rays done previously .
PROBLEM # 3 :
HISTORY OF DIZZINESS .
The patient complained of some dizziness and had a presyncopal episode prior to admission , however , the patient felt that her dizziness was unchanged from the dizziness that she had for several years .
She will be followed up by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
PROBLEM # 4 :
ANEMIA .
The patient had an anemia on admission .
She had normal iron and TIBC .
Reticulocyte count is pending at the time of this dictation .
I suspect that this is anemia of chronic disease , but could not rule out gastrointestinal blood loss , although she remained guaiac negative .
PROBLEM # 5 :
PYURIA .
The patient 8-10 white blood cells in the urine on admission , and the urine culture was no growth so far at the time of discharge .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is being discharged in stable condition , and is to be followed up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
She should arrange to be followed up by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
Her diet is a low cholesterol diet .

He became tachycardic to the rate of 110 , with a blood pressure of 128 to 130 .
He was pain free with EKG ST depressions laterally .
Around 4:00 p.m. this occurred and he was given a beta blocker 2.5 mg IV push times four .
His heart rate went down to 60 .
At this time , he was also given 25 mg po of Lopressor .
Later , within an half hour the blood pressure dipped into the 70s systolic , and IV fluid was started .
He complained of continued nausea and vomiting .
He was given Compazine PR and was started on Dopamine and then Dobutamine was added when that did not appear sufficient to increase his blood pressure above 80 .
He had a good urinary output .
His systolic blood pressure was then in the 100 to 110 range and at that time his IV fluids were decreased .
However , acutely at around 8:00 p.m. the systolic blood pressure plummeted down to 60 to 70 and at this time a chest x-ray was done which showed moderate CHF .
The patient complained of pain between his shoulder blades and at this time IV fluid was increased , so was the Dopamine and Dobutamine .
Even with the increase in the pressors , heart rate dropped into the 50s .
Atropine X 2 amps were given and the heart rate was in the 60s with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 to 90 range by Doppler .
Oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .
Surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump .
Central access was gained and a chest x-ray was done which showed no pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as NG tube .
He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .
Atropine one amp was given .
There was a question of fleeting T waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead EKG .
At this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .
At this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .
The rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.
The patient was without respirations or blood pressure .
The family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .
Autopsy was requested , however , the patient &apos;s family will not give us their decision until tomorrow morning .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">4/4</PHI>/93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
aortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfonamides .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
cardiac catheterization - <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Lasix 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .
He also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .
Despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .
Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .
Over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .
He returned for routine office evaluation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/25</PHI>/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .
Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .
The venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .
The carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .
There was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .
The right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .
There was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .
His chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .
The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , 1992 .
Later , an echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .
The left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .
The aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .
There was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .
The left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .
There was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .
LABORATORY DATA :
potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .
This was of uncertain significance .
The hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .
Over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .
Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .
Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 .
At the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .
There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .
Left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .
There was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .
The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .
The aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .
A dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .
A large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .
The posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .
The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .
The saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
These findings were reviewed with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Patella</PHI> and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> &apos;s management .
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .
It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .
He seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .
He is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .
We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wierst</PHI> and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">08-23</PHI>-92
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Intracerebral hemorrhage .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Status post resection of a cerebellar medulloblastoma .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 50 year old , right handed , white male with a history of resection of left cerebellar medulloblastoma , resected six years ago and status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy , with a six month history of 30 pound weight loss , who was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> with a left basilar ganglion hemorrhage .
At baseline , he had lived with his guardians , <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Pandeprob</PHI> , he was &quot; slow &quot; , walked with a very ataxic gait , did not talk much and spends most of his time watching TV and smoking .
He had had several months of increased difficulty swallowing and slurred speech .
A recent head computerized tomography scan in <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>/92 was negative .
He had been evaluated by his local medical doctor for his weight loss .
He was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> after being found in the bathroom , on the floor at 8 a.m. , unresponsive .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Cerebellar brain carcinoma , status post surgery , chemotherapy and radiation therapy six to seven years ago .
He had not had any recurrence .
He had history of alcohol abuse in the past .
There was no cardiac disease , hypertension or diabetes mellitus .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
A generally cachectic white male , resting quietly with his eyes closed .
His blood pressure was 140/70 , heart rate 75 .
The general medical examination was noted for bilateral temporal wasting .
His oropharynx was clear .
His skin was clear .
The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 , regular rate and rhythm , no murmur , rub or gallop .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly .
Extremities - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Pulses were 2+ throughout .
The rectal tone was normal with no enlarged prostate , and he was heme positive .
Neurologically , he opened his eyes with sternal rub , but not verbalization .
He did not have verbal communication and he did not follow verbal commands .
His pupils were asymmetric , 6 mm. to 4 mm. on the left , right pupil was 5 mm. reacting to 3 mm.
The discs were flat .
There was no retinopathy .
He responded to threat on the left , but not on the right .
He had a gag and good palpate movement .
The tongue was midline .
He had slight decreased corneal reflex on the right .
He lifted his left leg off the bed , but no against resistance .
His deep tendon reflexes were noted for symmetric reflexes with upper extremities being 2 and patella 3 .
LABORATORY DATA :
An erythrocyte sedimentation rate 3 , hematocrit 44 , white blood count 21.7 , lytes within normal limits .
The head computerized tomography scan without contrast showed a 3 x 3 x 5 cm. hemorrhage extending form the left Sylvian fissure and put amen to the left front oparietal lobe .
There was mass effect and some midline shift .
There was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to then Neurologic Intensive Care Unit .
On admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was a large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .
His blood pressure was not elevated .
The aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and B12 .
Once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .
An magnetic resonance imaging study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/17</PHI>/92 showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .
There was no enhancement seen in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .
Given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar mass .
This was followed up with a bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest I minus on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/27</PHI>/92 did not show the mass initially noted .
A cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for mass effect from the hematoma .
A testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for mass .
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and G-tube was performed at the same time .
There was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .
An abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non-enhancing .
The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .
Initially , the patient remained drowsy until Decadron was added to his medical regimen .
He awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the right side and ability to walk with assistance .
He was started on Dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .
This seemed to help him remarkably with increased activity .
His Decadron has been tapered slowly to zero and his examination on discharge was as follows :
He needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .
Speech was nonfluent with occasional single words .
He sleeps with a hypophonia , but occasionally will speak louder when he is in better spirits .
He followed all commands readily .
His pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .
There was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .
He still had a significant right central facial droop .
His gag was intact with palatal movements .
On repetitive testing with Speech Therapy had not been able to swallow in a safe manner .
Thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .
He squints with his left eye when he tries to focus and claims this is because he sees double .
He had approximately 4+ to 5/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities .
His left side was full .
He had marked dysmetria bilaterally , but left greater than right to finger to nose and his gait was very ataxic .
His deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the right with 3 right brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and patella .
HE had an upgoing toe .
On the left , his reflexes wee 2-2+ with a downgoing toe .
He had right clonus , which was sustained .
At that time , there was no evidence of a mass behind the hematoma .
It was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .
Thus , he should return to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> to have a repeat head computerized tomography scan in one month to further evaluate a possible mass lesion behind the hematoma .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with suspected metastatic lung cancer to the left proximal femur .
She underwent chest and abdominal CT .
The chest CT revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the right middle lobe , consistent with neoplastic disease .
CT was carried out to the level of the adrenals and kidneys , which appeared normal .
She underwent an open biopsy and bipolar hemiarthroplasty on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/27</PHI> without complication .
The frozen section revealed adenocarcinoma with characteristics most likely attributed to lung rather than the GI tract for primary site , based on the frozen section .
Final pathology was pending at the time of discharge .
She did well and progressed with physical therapy and was able to do stairs with crutches , ambulating with a walker by postoperative day # 5 .
She was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Breunspeelm</PHI> from Oncology , who felt that most likely it was metastatic lung cancer to the bone ; however , breast cancer remains a possibility .
He also noted that if it is metastatic breast cancer it is a more treatable condition .
He recommended that we check the ER status of the pathology , which we plan to do , and get a mammogram .
He also recommended considering radiotherapy to the lung lesion .
He also recommended that she be switched from Premarin to tamoxifen .

Ascending aortic dissection , cutaneous drug eruption , diarrhea , congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , anuric renal failure , stroke , postoperative bleeding , mitral regurgitation , history of rheumatic fever .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/93 - mitral valve replacement and replacement of ascending aorta .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">06/29</PHI>/93 - white cell scan ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/03</PHI>/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/05</PHI>/93 - brain magnetic resonance imaging study ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/05</PHI>/93 - abdominal computerized tomography scan ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07-08</PHI>-93 - cardiac ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/07</PHI>/93 - pelvic ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/09</PHI>/93 - barium enema ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/14</PHI>/93 - cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/93 - reopening of sternum ; <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/22</PHI>/93 - mediastinal exploration .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .
She was in her usual state of health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/15</PHI>/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .
There were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .
She was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .
Because of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">O Center</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Sondibrid Ey</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/20</PHI> , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
Her antibiotics were appropriately changed .
At the family &apos;s request , the patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
There was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
The patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .
She was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .
There was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .
She had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
Because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .
Her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .
Towards the end of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .
A rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/13</PHI> , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .
After considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .
Also , no source for sepsis had been found .
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .
Accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/93 .
During her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .
She , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .
Her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .
It was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .
Her valve was replaced with a St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
In the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .
The sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .
She was returned to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/22</PHI> and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .
Her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .
With clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .
She subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .
After consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/26</PHI>/93 at 11:10 a.m.

She has been under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aalv Manual</PHI> and was referred here for further therapy .
She had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor &apos;s office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain .
Her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .
Her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .
In addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08-03</PHI>-93 .
She developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support .
She underwent cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-15</PHI>-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .
She had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease .
The main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .
The left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .
The circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis .
Cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .
The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .
The patient was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> for consideration of coronary angioplasty .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES :
CT scan <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/5</PHI>/02 :
A fluid collection external to the fascia consistent with site of erythema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Urology .
After the wound was further opened , he was started on ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl antibiotics and he was placed on a bid dressing change and packing .
On hospital day 2 , the patient had no complaints .
He was afebrile with stable vital signs and good urine output .
The wound erythema was improving and the wound was packed twice a day .
We continued his ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl .
By hospital day 4 , he remained afebrile throughout his hospital course .
The wound cultures demonstrated gram-positive cocci in clusters and gram-negative rods .
Blood cultures remained negative .
The patient was continued on antibiotics and we obtained a CT scan to check for an enterocutaneous fistula .
We discontinued his Flagyl on that day .
He was continued on his dressing changes .
We changed the dressings tid instead of bid for continued drainage .
The CT scan that was obtained on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/10</PHI>/02 demonstrated no connection between bowel and the wound .
The drainage had been decreasing and the patient continued to be afebrile .
On the following day , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/11</PHI>/02 , a fistulogram was obtained which was negative for a fistula from the bowel to the wound .

1. Neuro :
The patient was started on heparin for concern of embolic ACA stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation or possibly artery to artery embolus given his left carotid stenosis .
The patient continued on hemodialysis .
He was seen by Interventional NeuroRadiology who recommended a CTA to better visualize question of left ICA stenosis .
CTA revealed patent ACA &apos;s with dominant left A1 segment , hypoplastic right A1 segment but good filling of anterior cerebrals bilaterally .
It did show stenosis of the left carotid proximal to the cavernous portion .
However it did show contrast throughout .
Given the embolic appearance of the stroke the patient was changed from heparin to Plavix and aspirin for anticoagulation .
He was not placed on Coumadin given discussion with his primary care doctor and history of multiple GI bleeds on aspirin alone .
He contined on hemodialysis and was started on Renogel and Nephrocaps for high phosphorus levels .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .
The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
On admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .
Her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , HDL32 , LDL 64 .
The patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .
It was unclear whether this was old or new .
A TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
Chest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .
The patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .
The cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .
Her blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .
She will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She is on an aspirin .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;
Pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .
Unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin .
An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .
Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .
She has episodes of not breathing .
BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
4. Hematology :
This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :
Low salt diet .
Low cholesterol , low fat diet .
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE :
To rehabilitation .
House diet .
No added salt .
Low saturated fat .
ACTIVITY :
As tolerated .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
The patient needs physical therapy to increase stability in mobilization .
Need to try to control blood pressure .
Can increase her Ace inhibitor as tolerated .
May start beta-blocker at a low dose given mild bradycardia at atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day .
Need to continue oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
Should continue Keflex for 10 more days or as clinically indicated .
Need to follow INR after Keflex is discontinued as expect it will change .
The patient has severe sleep apnea and stops breathing during sleep .
This is her baseline status .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 79 year old female whose cardiac risk factors include hyperlipidemia , hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , positive family history .
She had a minimally invasive single vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1998 , consisting of a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI> , she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> with a myocardial infarction , complicated by cardiogenic shock .
She had cardiac catheretization at that time , which revealed patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , a dominant left circumflex artery , with an 80% stenosis and a patent right coronary artery .
She underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement to the left circumflex artery .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/30</PHI>/02 she presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> again , with acute onset of shortness of breath while at rest , without other associated symptoms .
She was diuresed and underwent cardiac catheterization , reported as a 90% right coronary artery stenosis , 100% native left anterior descending , patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , sclerotiic distal LAD , 80% mid left circumflex stenosis ; posterior descending artery of 40% and 80% sequentially .
Echocardiogram at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with anteroapical aneurysm , EF of 20% , mild left atrial dilatation , aorticsclerosis and mild pulmonary hypertension .
She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> for Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , plus / minus brachy therapy .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
This is a 79 year old female , with acute distress .
BLOOD PRESSURE 110/60 , heart rate 60 , irregular .
HEENT - PERRLA , EOMI .
Neck was soft and supple .
JVP flat .
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with mildly diminished breath sounds at the bases .
S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen soft , with positive bowel sounds .
No bruits audible .
Lower extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
2+ bilateral femoral pulses without bruits .
LAB DATA RADIOLOGY :
Na 136 , K 4.5 , Cl 97 , CO2 26.7 .
BUN 29 , creat 1.7 .
Digoxin 1.0 , WBC 8.5 , hematocrit 34.5 , hemoglobin 11.2 , platelets 289 .
PT 13.7 / PTT 26.3 .
ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
This patent was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Memasound Honvanta Hospital</PHI> .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/8</PHI>/02 she underwent a Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex in stent restenosis with a 3.0 x 10.0 cutting balloon and then underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the distal left circumflex lesion , followed by deployment of the 2.0 x 13.0 mm Pixel stent .
Following post deployment inflation , the vessel was at full volume without clot or dissection , and TIMI 3 flow .
She was maintained on Integrilin for 12 hours ; her sheaths were removed without difficulty .
After sheath removal , she was started on Fragmin in anticipation of maintaining anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation .
She felt right leg weakness during the procedure , but experienced a great deal of difficulty the following morning , ambulating to the bathroom due to this weakness , which resolved after 2-3 hours .
She was seen in consultation by Neurology .
She underwent head CT which showed old lacunes and bilateral basal ganglia and ? of small hypodensity in the left frontal lobe .
After her right lower extremity weakness resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .
She had no further neurologic symptoms .
Post cath she developed contrast induced acute renal failure , with peak creat of 2.3 .
She was seen in consultation by the Renal service who followed along closely .
Eventually she had renal MRA which was reported as showing severe right renal artery stenosis .
In order to evaluate this , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/21</PHI> she underwent renal MRA which showed only moderate right renal artery stenosis that was non-obstructive .
Following the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .
There was no evidence of GI bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .
She was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .
This echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .
She was seen in consultation by PT , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .
She was found to have a 4 x normal risk of falling , which was felt to be significant .
She however is at increased risk for further embolic phenomenon with atrial fibrillation .
She was maintained on Fragmin and will be considered for lowdose Coumadin once the Plavix is finished in a month if her gait and strength have improved .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
She is ready for discharge to a nursing facility for further strength training .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient is an 80 year old female with a history of dementia , and of a choreoathetotic movement disorder of unclear etiology .
She has had these problems for approximately 10 years , and is cared for by a family member .
W / U for Huntington &apos;s , ceruloplasmin , TSH , etc have all been negative in the past .
Now presents with report of sub-acute worsening of confusion .
Patient was admitted to neurology service .
She had a gradual imporvement of her confusion back towards baseline during the hospital stay .
The major therapeutic change during the hospitalization was the starting of zyprexa to see if as part of its side-effect profile it would decrease the choreoathetotic movement symptoms .
Infact , this medication was found to cause a significant improvement in her choreoathetotic perioral and arm movements .
She still has significant myoclonic component in her arms especially with volition , but this med will certainly be continued .
While essentially what we ARE hoping for in this use of the med is extra-pyramidal side effects , she should be monitored for any excessive or debilitating parkinsonian symptoms such as excessive rigidity .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">08/15</PHI>/2002
This is a 70-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis and peritoneal hemodialysis for ten years , transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ton University Hospital</PHI> for further evaluation of change in mental status .
She was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Aper Hospital</PHI> for change in mental status on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/19</PHI>/2002 .
Initial work up was unrevealing .
She was discharged to rehabilitation and developed disorientation , confusion , incoordination , and apparent paranoia .
She was diagnosis with a urinary tract infection and perineal inflammation and was transferred to the hospital and treated with IV Tequin for urinary tract infection .
Throughout her admission , she experienced occasional low-grade temperatures to 99 Fahrenheit with persistent leukocytosis .
Herperitoneal fluid cultures have all been negative and showed only 3 polys .
There was a question of 3 x 4 collection around the peritoneal catheter that was investigated with an I+ abdominal CT scan that was not conclusive .
She was switched , however , to hemodialysis from peritoneal dialysis .
Only 1 white blood cell was detected , and the fluid was culture and gram stain negative .
Work up also included a negative PPD , Clostridium difficile toxin , blood cultures , and head CT scan .
An electroencephalogram showed nonspecific , left greater than right slowing , without epileptiform spikes .
A Speech and Swallow evaluation initially deemed her an aspiration risk , and she was taken of PO &apos;s .
Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was found to be 48 .
Lupus anticoagulant was weakly positive , as was a D-dimer .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for end-stage renal disease secondary to chronic urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis with vesicoureteral reflux .
Peritoneal dialysis x ten years , resulting from that .
And status post right nephrectomy , status post cholecystectomy , ____________thyroidectomy .

She denies the use of tobacco or ethanol .
She was raised in the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</PHI> and spent many years on an organic farm .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile at 98.7 , blood pressure 128/64 , heart rate 96 , respiratory rate 22 , 02 s 96% on room air .
In general , she was well appearing in no apparent distress .
The pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation .
The oropharynx was moist .
The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm .
There was no palpable lymphadenopathy .
The chest was clear bilaterally .
The heart had a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with good bowel sounds .
There was no hepatosplenomegaly .
There was only mild suprapubic fullness that was not tender .
There was no guarding or rebound .
There was no peripheral edema .
On neurologic examination , the patient followed only simple commands .
She had decreased strength bilaterally .
There was a questionable positive Babinski on the right side .
The toes were downgoing on the left .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 .

Her white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 .
The hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 .
Abdominal CT scan from the outside hospital showed no abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts .
The electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .
Head CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/30</PHI>/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe .
As noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative Clostridium difficile , a weakly positive D-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient &apos;s presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer &apos;s of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .
In concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .
An lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .
In addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .
In addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .
For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .
For her FEN , the patient was able to take PO &apos;s and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take PO &apos;s with one to one supervision .
For prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .
From an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/10</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/12</PHI>/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .
Excellent suggestions from Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Pa</PHI> of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient &apos;s weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .
However , these antibodies were both within normal limits .
The patient &apos;s mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/10</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/12</PHI> and was markedly improved on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/13</PHI>/2002 , compared with the day of admission .
However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .
The nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .
On the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .
CA-125 levels were within normal limits .
We entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .
Pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Termarimed</PHI> pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .

The patient has baseline hypertension that was difficult to control .
In the ICU , the patient was on enalapril , hydralazine and labetalol .
After a Cardiology consulton <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/13</PHI>/03 , the patient was started on metoprolol 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg q.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d. .
Hydralazine was stopped .
Blood pressure stayed high with an SBP in the 170s , so amlodipine 10 mg q.d. was added and that blood pressure was still elevated .
3. Pulmonary :
Once the patient was extubated , after the third surgery , the patient could not be weaned off 2 liters of nasal cannula and was to ______ to 20 breaths per minute despite nebulizer treatment .
4. GI :
On postoperative day 4 , after the initial surgery , the patient had increased shortness of breath and tachycardia with abdominal pain .
A chest x-ray revealed increased free air under the diaphragm .
A CT revealed a large amount of free air .
On postop day 9 , the patient had a similar increased abdominal pain episode and was taken back to the operating room for another emergent exploratory laparotomy revealing another peroration at the site of previous repair .
Intraoperatively , the patient suffered hypotension with induction and respiratory insufficiency .
The patient was transferred to the ICU intubated with stable .
The patient was kept NPO with an NG tube until postop day 14 and_____ started on clear sips with TPN for nutritional supplementation .
The patient intermittently tolerated diet advancement , but then would vomit and would have the NG tube replaced .
The patient still had a PICC line at the time , although TPN was being held and calorie counts were done to evaluate the benefit of p.o. nutrition .
5. GU :
No issues .
The patient generally had good urine output .

REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Tennis</PHI> is a 65-year-old , white male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Utal Health</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .
Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions .
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Kennedy</PHI> with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to OM of the left circumflex .
The vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality .
He has had numerous interval admissions to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Shoreale Medical Health</PHI> for congestive heart failure of an increasing pattern in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/93 and <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 and then every three weeks since the beginning of the year .
His primary event complaints are episodes of shortness of breath with neck pain without radiation but with dizziness , light-headedness , pallor , and some chest pressure .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He also complains of 30-yard dyspnea on exertion and one-block claudication .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Carbon</PHI> , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
His Procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on Amiodarone .
However , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .
The night before admission , his blood pressure was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 .
He took Nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms .
He came to the Emergency Room for evaluation .
In the Emergency Room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% O2 saturation .
He was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .

Blood pressure was 154/90 in the right and 150/82 in the left .
Pulse was varying between 120 and 140 .
He was afebrile .
His respiratory rate was 20 .
Saturation was 98% in room air .
On HEENT exam , pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation .
Extraocular movements were intact .
He had a furrowed tongue , but hisoropharynx was otherwise negative .
He had no carotid bruits with good bilateral upstroke .
His JVP was difficult to assess with a questionable meniscus near the ear at 45 degrees .
Cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate .
The PMI was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .
Heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .
An S2 split was not appreciated .
There was no apparent S3 .
Chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .
Abdomen was obese .
Abdominal exam revealed surgical scars and questionable hepatojugular reflux .
Liver was 10 cm. in width , 2 to 3 cm. below the rib .
Rectal exam was heme negative .
Extremities were warm with good distal pulses .
Neurologic exam was non focal .
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact .
Reflexes were less than 1+ symmetrically .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , hematocrit was 40 , white count 7.18 , platelets 250 , sodium 138 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 31 , creatinine 1.5 .
Digoxin level was 1.3 .
The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable P-R interval , QRS of 0.09 , and QTC of 0.42 .
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was loaded on Amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed .
His left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to OM was not detected by the aortic root shot .
The ejection fraction was not calculated .
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed , and his medications were tailored over the course of the following 48 hours by following the appropriate parameters .
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no EKG changes during these episodes .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/22</PHI> , after an appropriate load of Amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .
There were no complications from this procedure , and he remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of discharge .
He was reloaded back upon Coumadin and reached a therapeutic INR .
He was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 24th</PHI> with follow-up of his PT / PTT values on Friday , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">25th</PHI> , as well as three times a week in the following week , and follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Most</PHI> within two weeks .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Amiodarone 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for the first two weeks , decreasing to 200 mg. p.o. q.d. in the subsequent time .
Coumadin 5 mg. p.o. q.h.s. Axid 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d. Nitro paste 2 in chestopical from bedtime until 8:00 a.m.
DISPOSITION :
He was discharged to home .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :

Zestril , 10 , b.i.d. , coumadin , to be regulated , digoxin , 0.125 mg. , alternating with 0.25 , every other day , verapamil , 80 , 4 times a day , Asthmacort , four puffs , b.i.d. , Atrovent , 2 puffs , 4 times a day , and quinine sulfate , 325 , q.h.s.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/28</PHI>/76 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Melvean Ace</PHI> .
She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. &apos;s .
She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .
She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.
Her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .
In 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Times</PHI> , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .
She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Avejoh Wierst</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Pedines Community Hospital</PHI> found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .
A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .
This was on diltiazem and digoxin .
At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .
Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .
We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .
Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .
She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .
Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/4</PHI> , and diltiazem was restarted .
A cardiac catheterization was carried out on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/5</PHI> , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .
It showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .
The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .
The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram .
There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .
The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .
Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .
With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .
A permanent pacemaker was put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/6</PHI>/92 .
This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
She tolerated the procedure well .
On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .
On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .
We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .
If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Avejoh Wierst</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Em Neighburce</PHI> .

The patient underwent echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 25</PHI> , 1997 , demonstrating 2/4+ tricuspid regurgitation with a peak velocity of 2.9 ; mitral regurgitation 2/4 , mild concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle ; no systolic function with mild septal hypokinesis .
The ejection fraction was estimated at 55% .
The aortic valve appeared sclerotic with mild to moderate insufficiency .
The ascending aorta appeared severely dilated immediately after the root at 7.7 centimeters .
Dissection flap was noted .
There was pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 34 mmHg plus right atrial pressure .
There was also evidence of a secundum type atrioseptal defect , approximately 0.5 centimeters in size , with elevated right atrial pressure .
The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 25</PHI> , 1997 , demonstrating elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 19 , right ventricular pressure of 56/19 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/39 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24/26/21 .
Evidence of atrioseptal defect again was noted with a calculation of 2:1 .
Non selective coronary arteriography performed did not reveal the presence of any focal coronary artery disease .
The aortic root angiography revealed the presence of an extensive ascending aortic dissection .
True lumen could not be accessed from either the left or right femoral artery .
The true lumen required access by right radial artery and tortuous innominate artery .
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 26</PHI> , 1997 , where she underwent resection and repair of chronic aortic dissection and reconstruction of the super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 as well as primary repair of an atrioseptal defect which appeared consistent with a patent foramen ovale and was 1-2 centimeters insize .
On postoperative day number one , however , the patient was hemodynamically stable on a small amount of heparin and nitroglycerin with a cardiac index of 3 .
The patient required diuresis in her course after receiving multiple blood products .
Beta blocker was started as well .
The patient was transferred to the floor after a slow ventilator wean .
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number three .
She did demonstrate evidence of a right brachial neuropathy , likely associated with the extensive dissection required for access to the right axillary artery , given the patient &apos;s distorted anatomy due to the large dissection .
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and received therapy to the right upper extremity and hand .
She will require continued therapy .
Otherwise the patient was neurologically intact .
She has worked well with Physical Therapy with regard to ambulation and has tolerated a regular diet without difficulty .
The patient was in persistent atrial fibrillation postoperatively .
The determination was made not to Coumadinize the patient given herchronic descending thoracic dissection and history of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient has been chronically in atrial fibrillation preoperatively without Coumadin therapy .
The patient did require extensive pulmonary toilet and she continues to benefit from nebulizer therapy , chest physiotherapy and diuresis .
On 2 liters nasal cannulaoxygen , she is saturating at 93-95% .
The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation for reconditioning in general and specifically in regard to her right upper extremity .
She will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Spotted</PHI> in four to six weeks ; with her cardiologist in one week .

Chest x-ray <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 :
Elevated left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology or duration .
Postoperative changes of the sternum and media stinum were seen and no acute pulmonary disease was visualized .
The patient also had a shoulder film done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .
A lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
The fracture fragments retained their proper site of articulation with the glenoid fossa .
Innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal humeral shaft .
The glenoid fossa was intact .
No scapular fractures were present .
normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , Q - waves seen in II , III , and AVF with probable old inferior myocardial infarction .
T - waves were also noted to be inverted in I and AVL .
Ventricular bigeminy was also seen .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
The patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17</PHI>/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
No chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/12</PHI>/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Columbus Day</PHI> which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
After his procedure on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17</PHI>/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19</PHI>/97 to <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/20</PHI>/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19</PHI>/97 , and all muscular in origin .
4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :
GI was consulted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/15</PHI>/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/15</PHI>/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .
This report needs to be followed up , and will be available at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fordwoodall Stick</PHI> , in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156</PHI> .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
The patient &apos;s admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient received chest physical therapy bid .
6. ENDOCRINE :
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/23</PHI>/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19</PHI>/97 showed moderate occult blood , pH 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/22</PHI>/97 was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
He was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 and also had Nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .
The patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/97 to 25/1.9 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/23</PHI>/97 .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units of <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/16</PHI>/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19</PHI>/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 .
The patient transfused 2 units on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/20</PHI>/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 .
FEN :
Repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .
The patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS :
HYPERCALCEMIA .
INFERIOR VENA CAVA OBSTRUCTION .
IMPENDING SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION .
IDENTIFICATION DATA :
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a 22 week intrauterine pregnancy who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> with diffuse metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was in her usual state of excellent health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
Subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/23</PHI> , she was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Stonge</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
A fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
Subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/5</PHI> , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> under local anesthesia .
The pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .
This prompted further staging work-up .
The patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
A specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nimaconwood Valley Hospital</PHI> for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .
Over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .
She has had no motor weakness , abnormal sensation , numbness , tingling or incontinence of bowel or bladder .
She denied fevers , chills or sweats .
There has been no GI or GU symptoms except for constipation .

White blood cell count was 11.14 .
PT was 13.2 .
PTT was 29.8 .
The patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/13</PHI>/91 .
The work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
Work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .
The abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed no suspicious GI masses , no pancreatic mass ; a 2 cm ovarian cyst .
The review of the pathology from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> confirmed a high grade adenocarcinoma .
Erica and basic cystic protein stains are still pending .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .
2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .
3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/17</PHI>/91 .
He was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
He was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> as an out-patient .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/06</PHI>/91 , he was seen in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">FLFDMC</PHI> and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .
He was evaluated in the Emergency Room .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .
Cultures were taken and he was sent out .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/08</PHI>/91 , the patient called Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
He was seen in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">FLFDMC</PHI> where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .
2) Recent PCP .
3) Status post right elbow surgery .
4) Venereal disease history .
5) PPD anergic .
The patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .

On presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .
SKIN :
Jaundiced .
HEENT :
Revealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .
NECK :
He had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .
LUNGS :
Had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .
CARDIAC :
Showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .
His liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .
His spleen was not palpable .
RECTAL :
He had guaiac positive stools .
EXTREMITIES :
Unremarkable .
GENITOURINARY :
His penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .
PT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .
Sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .
( On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/06</PHI> , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .
His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .
His chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .
However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/11</PHI>/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/11</PHI>/91 .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/12</PHI>/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/13</PHI>/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/16</PHI>/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/15</PHI>/91 .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/18</PHI>/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.
DISPOSITION :
The patient died in hospital .
An autopsy will be performed .
An autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .

WORD DISABILITY AND PROBABLY DURATION :
The patient is disabled .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotereef</PHI> is a <PHI TYPE="AGE">93-year-old</PHI> woman who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daleglo Medical Center</PHI> with renal insufficiency .
The patient was in her usual state of health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/10</PHI>/98 when she was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daleglo Medical Center</PHI> with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes .
She was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days .
The patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
She was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated .
She was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated BUN and creatinine and failure to eat .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1997 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness .
There was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .
The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
She also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .
On arrival to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .
However , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination her pulse was 55 .
Her systolic blood pressure was 110 .
She appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .
BUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .
A chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .
A KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 25</PHI> where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .
A urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .
A head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .
There was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient &apos;s diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .
The patient had been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
At that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
She was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .
However , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .
Her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
A cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
Multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .
There was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
Her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .
Her BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .
The patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .
Her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
However , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
However , with the assistance of the patient &apos;s granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .
The patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .
Nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .
The patient will be transferred tomorrow to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Naplesvillechaelty</PHI> .
I will get in touch with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Areas</PHI> and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .

She has had one pervious episode of variceal bleeding with an unclear date .
However she is followed by a Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Joasscchird</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vaila Medical Center</PHI> .
She was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she felt increasing fatigue , nausea and vomiting productive of bright red blood and coffee ground emesis .
At <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vaila Medical Center</PHI> , she had a hematocrit of 25 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells .
She had an upper endoscopy at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Va Sit Namar Healthcare</PHI> showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .
She was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .
The GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .
Her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .
after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .
At that time she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Coden 2</PHI> for the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lemgarson Hospital</PHI> service .

PT was 14.5 , PTT 25.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lemgarson Hospital</PHI> service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 26</PHI> when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Va Sit Namar Healthcare</PHI> and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the <PHI TYPE="DATE">2th</PHI> the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">North Dakota</PHI> .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Joasscchird</PHI> , tel. <PHI TYPE="PHONE">090-249-6079</PHI> , at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Va Sit Namar Healthcare</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Acrookesjo</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Do Of Hospital</PHI> , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">AH</PHI> and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Acrookesjo</PHI> in one week and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Work</PHI> the gastrointestinal fellow here at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">PUOMC</PHI> in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .
Zoloft 50 mg PO QD , Lactulose 15 g PO BID , Synthroid 0.15 mg PO QD , Prilosec 20 mg PO BID .

The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with axis of 0 degrees and normal intervals .
There were no ST-T wave changes .
Head computerized tomography scan revealed diffuse cortical atrophy , increased ventricles and no acute bleed .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Dehydration .
The patient was mildly dehydrated at time of admission and was replaced with intravenous fluids until she began taking good PO intake .
By the end of her hospitalization she was eating well on her own .
2. Infectious Disease .
Admission urinalysis revealed 5-10 red blood cells , 10-20 white blood cells and few bacteria .
Therefore the patient was started on Bactrim for urinary tract infection .
She did not tolerate oral medication initially and was switched to intravenous ampicillin .
The antibiotics were discontinued after three days of intravenous antibiotic therapy .
A repeat urinalysis done later in the course of the hospitalization revealed no white blood cells .
3. Psychiatric .
The patient underwent neuropsychiatric testing .
This evaluation revealed a woman with multifaceted loss of intellectual functioning who falls well within the range of SDAT group .
Conclusion was that this was a dementing process .
The testing was performed by a staff neuropsychologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lornsook Trusmoag</PHI> , PhD , telephone number <PHI TYPE="PHONE">959-1490</PHI> .
She stated that she would be happy to reevaluate Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fleetheesc</PHI> in the future if necessary .
4. Parotid swelling .
Approximately five days into the hospital stay it was noted that the patient had significant right parotid swelling .
Plain films revealed soft tissue swelling , neck and face computerized tomography scan revealed a nonspecific enlarged right parotid gland with increased attenuation consistent with an inflammatory or neoplastic process .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so a contrast study was not available .
The patient was evaluated by ENT who felt that her enlargement was more likely secondary to an inflammatory process although they could not rule out malignancy .
Cytology consult was called , but by the time the cytologist came to do a fine needle aspiration the mass had shrunken to the point where there was nothing to aspirate .
It was felt that attempting a biopsy and beginning antibiotic treatment was not indicated at this time as the mass had entirely resolved .
The ENT physician who saw the patient is Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freieslowkays</PHI> .
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freieslowkays</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 8</PHI> , 1994 at 1:20 p.m. at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital</PHI> .
The phone number is <PHI TYPE="PHONE">610-7597</PHI> .
5. Physical Therapy .
The patient &apos;s baseline is that she is able to walk with the assistance of her brother or sister at home .
However , she has been reluctant to even move from the bed to the chair since admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
Physical Therapy has been working with her .
Fear of falling seems to be a large component of this , and the patient will likely need considerable patience in convincing her it is okay to get out of bed again .

FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
Cervical carcinoma ; bilateral ureteral obstruction secondary to the cancer .
Uremia .
Ileus .
OPERATION :
Bilateral ureteral stent placement .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 78-year-old woman had stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix and she has known periaortic and splenic metastases .
She was discharged from the hospital about 18 days prior to her admission , following a month long stay .
When her cancer was diagnosed , she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
She had extensive disease of the uterus , ovarian tubes , omentum and the periaortic lymph nodes .
Postoperatively , she developed ileus , then finally she recovered and she was discharged to the nursing home .
She was readmitted because of a problem with uremia and high BUN and creatinine when she seen in the office and the BUN and creatinine was ordered .
The BUN was 70 and creatinine was 4.6 and for this reason she had ultrasound of the kidney which showed bilateral hydronephrosis .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for ureteral stent placement .
On the day of admission , she was generally stable and she had no evidence of disease in the pelvis , no bleeding and no other abnormality .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jescdrig</PHI> was called and a consultation was done and he placed bilateral ureteral stents in her kidneys .
Postoperatively , she diuresed very well .
Because of her age and mental condition and the fact that she had cerebral atrophy , the decision was made for comfort unless she has any further problem and no further chemotherapy or treatment will be given .
The possibility that she may need to receive radiation therapy to this area to prevent her from getting further obstruction was also brought up .
Her family felt that at the present time , because her condition was no good , they would like to just take her home so that she could enjoy the quality of life .
Indeed , at the time of discharge she was conscious and she was cooperative and she was able to communicate very nicely with everyone including her family , except for the mental instability that she had because of her cerebral atrophy due to senility .
FOLLOW-UP :
She will be followed in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Centu Fairgmer Queen Medical Center</PHI> .

A computerized tomography scan was felt to be normal .
In 1989 , she started developing incoordination in her left upper extremity .
A magnetic resonance imaging study at that time revealed a left CPA tumor with pontine compression .
This tumor was partially resected in <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/89 with nondiagnostic pathology , finally labeled as a hamartoma .
She was followed with serial imaging studies .
She had developed increasing tumor growth and increasing symptoms over the past three months , consisting of decreased ambulation , frequent falls and unable to get up the stairs of a bus due to proximal weakness .
She also noticed loss of balance .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>/93 , she had a magnetic resonance imaging study that revealed a large complex extra-axial mass centered in the left CPA with marked mass effect on the brainstem , left temporal lobe and the left parapharyngial space .
There was no change compared with a previous study of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/92 .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was positive for an injury to the right third finger with a soiled razor blade .

MICU COURSE-The patient was continued on Bactrim at 15 mg / kg per day in divided doses for his PCP pneumonia .
The patient was switched from p.o. Prednisone to IV Solu-Medrol at equivalent therapeutic doses .
The patient &apos;s respiratory wheezes were treated symptomatically with bronchodilators .
The patient &apos;s anemia was treated with folate , iron , and vitamin B-12 .
The patient was noted to be agitated at times with acute oxygen desaturations at these times .
The patient was started on a Morphine drip for control .
The patient &apos;s peak inspiratory pressures were noted to be elevated , consistent with an ARDS picture .
The patient was therefore started on pressure controlled ventilation resulting in a decrease in his PIP from 60 to 45 .
The patient was also noted to have decreased urine output with an acute increase in his creatinine from 1.5 to 2.2 .
Despite improvement in his chest x-ray noted on that day which was believed to be attributable to the steroids , the patient was switched to IV Pentamidine given the possibility of myelosuppression by Bactrim .
Consultation with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Test</PHI> led to a plan to begin aerosolized Pentamidine 100 mg nebilized q.d. for three days while therapeutic levels of Pentamidine could be build up in the lungs via IV .
However , the patient was noted to become increasingly hypotensive with decreased urine output .
The patient became anuric with increasing metabolic acidosis .
The patient was started on Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 hours for presumed sepsis .
Despite this measure , the patient became increasingly hypotensive requiring the addition of Dopamine and Levophed drips .
The patient &apos;s condition deteriorated overnight with increasing metabolic acidosis despite bicarbonate .
The patient &apos;s oliguria renal failure continued despite fluid boluses and diuretics .
The patient &apos;s electrolytes became increasingly difficult to manage with hyperkalemia , hyperphosphatemia , and hypocalcemia .
On the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/11</PHI>/91 , the patient &apos;s blood pressure dropped to 60/palpable despite the addition of Neo-Synephrine .
At this time , his arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.07 , and the patient became aystolic .
The patient was subsequently declared dead at 7:58 A.M.
Medications at the time of death :
Pentamidine 100 mg nebulized q.d. times three days , Pentamidine 300 mg IV q.d. , Solu-Medrol 20 mg IV t.i.d. , Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 , Morphine sulfate drip at 5 mg / hour IV , Dopamine drip 18 mcg / kg/min IV drip , Pavulon 2 mg IV q1hour , Levophef 16 mcg / min IV drip , ferrous sulfate 324 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , Folate 1 mg per NG tube q.d. , vitamin B-12 , Colace , vitamin K , senna .

there was no distinct costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Slightly distended .
There was mild tenderness to palpation in the right mid lateral abdomen .
There were no peritoneal signs and no guarding .
There were normal bowel sounds .
EXTREMITIES :
Without edema .
PELVIC :
By Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> revealed regrowth of the pelvic tumor .
There was a dry scaly rash with multiple small scabs on the left perineum and posterior thigh .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Her electrolytes were within normal limits , her BUN was ll , and creatinine was 0.8 .
Her ALT was l0 , total bilirubin 0.4 , and magnesium was l.8 .
Her admission CBC revealed a white blood count of 2.27 , with 56 polys and 3 bands .
Her hematocrit was 22.9 and platelets were l24 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The bone scan was performed which revealed multiple metastases to the spine , ribs , and skull .
There was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur .
Plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .
The Radiation Service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .
Planning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the Radiation Service .
She was given Synalar Cream and Eucerin Cream as a moisturizer .
The patient also received a unit of donor direct blood .
Due to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> &apos;s concern that the tumor was growing despite the available chemotherapeutic regimen , the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Im Villtro University Medical Center</PHI> Medical Oncology Service was consulted .
They noted , as well , that she had failed the most active agents against small cell carcinomas .
The plan at this time was made to further consider the options and the patient will follow-up with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Im Villtro University Medical Center</PHI> next week .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a long history of alcohol abuse , withdrawal seizures , and hypopharyngeal cancer now admitted with foreign body in hypopharynx .
The patient has a long history of alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease as well as seizure disorder related to alcohol withdrawal and multiple <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> admissions for detox and multiple detox facilities in the past .
The patient also recently ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">06</PHI>/93 ) was diagnosed with infiltrating cancer of the hypopharynx and was scheduled to undergo XRT but had not yet started .
Recently the patient noticed hoarseness secondary to vocal cord involvement of the tumor .
On the day of admission the patient was in a detox center undergoing detox prior to beginning his XRT and was in his usual state of health at that time when he had the acute onset of coughing after swallowing some chicken a la king .
The patient also was noted to have secretions draining from his mouth .
He denied any shortness of breath at that time .
In the Emergency Room the patient underwent EGD by GI where a large piece of chicken was visualized at the level of the cricopharyngeus .

MEDICATIONS :
On transfer included Dilantin 100 mg po t.i.d. , Ceclor , Motrin , Percocet p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission he is a disheveled elderly male uncooperative with the exam .
Vital signs revealed the patient was afebrile , blood pressure 150/90 , pulse 86 and regular , respiratory rate 24 , and oxygen saturation 91% on room air .
HEENT exam revealed sclerae were injected , pupils equal and reactive .
Neck exam no JVD or lymphadenopathy .
Chest exam coarse upper airway sounds , no rales .
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Abdominal exam obese , hypoactive bowel sounds , non-tender , some guarding , no rebound tenderness .
Extremities with trace pedal edema , 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission Hct 42.1 , white count 7.6 , platelets 132 .
Dilantin level 13.7 .
SMA 7 was unremarkable aside from a glucose of 173 and a potassium of 3.1 .
LFTs revealed ALT of 44 , AST of 36 , LDH of 277 , alk phos 155 , total bili 0.7 , and direct bili 0.4. Total protein 7.2 , albumin 3.7 , calcium 9.3. PT and PTT were 13.3 and 23.5 respectively .
UA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By systems -
1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .
Extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .
EGD was performed .
Subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .
There was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .
The patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .
The patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .
Other GI issues include the patient &apos;s hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .
2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .
Because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .
3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .
A swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .
Several NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .
The patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .
He was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient &apos;s mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .
Other options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient &apos;s poor prognosis for the future .
The family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient &apos;s nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .
It is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .
4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .
The chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .
However , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .
The patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .
No organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .
5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .
It was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .
He had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .
The patient continued to be asymptomatic .
6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .
The patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .
These issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .
Psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .
It was decided the patient &apos;s code status would not be DNR , DNI .
8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .
Laboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .
CBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .
The last PT and PTT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/26</PHI>/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .
The last UA and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/27</PHI>/93 .
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/27</PHI>/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .
A faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .
Extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21</PHI>/93 .
COMPLICATIONS :
1) Aspiration pneumonia .
2) GI bleed .
3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .
DISPOSITION :
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient is stable on discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Pepcid 20 mg po IV b.i.d. for history of gastritis and GI bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. ( this may be discontinued as the patient becomes more mobile and active ) , tube feeds with Jevity at 75 cc / hour full strength-please check residuals .
Feeding tube should be flushed q4h with 20 to 30 cc of warm water to prevent clogging of feeding tube .

She had a J and J PFC system cemented in place without any wedges or graft .
She tolerated the procedure well .
Postoperatively she was treated with an epidural , however the epidural was not working very well and due to the patient &apos;s age and sensitivity to narcotics , she was switched over to intermittent morphine and then oral analgesics .
She received Coumadin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and cefazolin for infection prophylaxis .
Her neurovascular exam did not change postoperatively .
She was mobilized with physical therapy with gradual partial weightbearing on the right lower extremity and was given CPM to increase her range of motion .
Her postoperative hematocrit was 29 and then 31.4 without transfusion .
A preoperative urinary culture grew organisms sensitive to Bactrim , which was started after the cefazolin was discontinued and she will continue this for seven days .
The patient &apos;s postoperative films were fine .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Pa</PHI> is a 67 year old woman with a history notable for congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , transient ischemic attacks and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
Over the few months prior to admission the patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion and increasing weight gain to the tune of approximately 30 lbs despite increasing diuresis by her primary care physician .
An echocardiogram at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> in 1997 revealed a normal ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormality .
By her primary care physicians report an echocardiogram at an outside hospital in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 1999 revealed mild left atrial enlargement and mild right ventricular dilatation .
The primary care physician also reports an increasing new mitral regurgitation murmur over the past several weeks .
The patient has a Persantin Thallium stress test at an outside hospital on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/22</PHI>/99 which reportedly was negative for ischemia .
She has had no chest pain .
She does not smoke and has no history of coronary artery disease .
Three days prior to admission , secondary to increasing difficulty with ambulation and dyspnea on exertion the patient was admitted to a nursing home .
Outside the hospital the patient is non-compliant with her diet running her sugars in the 200s despite NPH insulin .
On arrival to the nursing home she was fed an in-house diet which was markedly less coloric and sugar filled than her home diet .
Early on the morning of admission the patient was found down , diaphoretic and responsive only to sternal rub .
Her blood sugar was 48 .
Emergency Medical Service was called .
The patient was intubated , given thiamine and D50 as well as intravenous Lasix and she was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room .
In the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room she was afebrile with a blood pressure 150/80 , heart rate in the 60s , oxygen saturation of 100% .
She was arousable to sternal rub only .
Her chest x-ray showed only mild failure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy , nephropathy and retinopathy status post laser treatment .
Severe degenerative joint disease of the spine and knees .
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation given a history of gastrointestinal bleed .
Upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
Hypercholesterolemia status post multiple transient ischemic attacks in the past , status post a right hemiparesis which has now resolved on aspirin .
History of supraventricular tachycardia in <PHI TYPE="DATE">06</PHI>/99 felt secondary to Desipramine toxicity .
Magnetic resonance imaging scan at that time notable only for chronic white matter changes .
Congestive heart failure .
Hypertension .
Hypothyroidism .
Endometrial hyperplasia .
Fibromyalgia .
Essential tremor .
Glaucoma .
ALLERGIES :
Ultram .
Melphalan .
Desipramine which causes supraventricular tachycardia .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives in a nursing home .
No alcohol use .
No drug use .
No tobacco use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was arousable to voice .
Pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accomodation .
Extra-ocular movements intact .
She was moving all four extremities .
Toes were down going bilaterally .
Vital signs :
temperature 95.1 F , heart rate 89 beats per minute in sinus rhythm .
Blood pressure 165/90 .
Pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accomodation .
Extra-ocular movements intact .
Neck supple and non-tender without thyromegaly or nodules .
2+ carotid pulses without bruits .
Jugular venous pressure 10 cm .
Lungs with crackles bilaterally up the lung field .
Heart regular rate and rhythm with a 1/6 systolic murmur with question of an opening snap .
A diastolic murmur was noted by one listener .
Abdomen had mild right upper quadrant tenderness with positive bowel sounds .
Extremities had marked pitting edema bilaterally .
Right heel ulcer with eschar .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Plasma sodium 134 , plasma carbon dioxide 34.8 , blood urea nitrogen 67 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 165 , liver function tests were normal .
Amylase 473 , lipase 6.8 , white blood cell count 7.4 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets 222 .
Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrate and minimal linear atelectasis in the right mid lung zone .
KUB showed no bowel obstruction .
Electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm with no changes compared with prior electrocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By system .
The patient &apos;s seizure was thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia in the setting of decreased oral intake on her standard anti-glycemic medications .
She will be transferred back to her long term care facility on a CZI sliding scale for close management of her sugars pending further assessment of her baseline anti-glycemic medication needs .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks in the past .
Her seizure was thought secondary to hypoglycemia and she had no further seizure activity in the hospital .
She did have some slightly paranoid behavior which her son says is typical .
She was continued on her Trazodone , Neurontin and Zyprexa .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient had an echocardiogram which revealed a normal ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities but mitral stenosis with peak gradient of 19 and mean gradient of 9 , dilated right ventricle , dilated right atrium , and right ventricle systolic pressure in the 60s .
She was aggressively diuresed and her shortness of breath somewhat improved as did her pedal edema .
After discussion with her primary care physician it was decided that she would have further cardiology assessment as an outpatient .
4. PULMONARY :
The patient was extubated quickly after her admission and maintained good oxygen saturation .
5. GASTROINTESTINAL :
The patient had guaiac positive stools and had an elevated amylase without an elevated lipase .
These findings suggest some bowel pathology .
The patient is known to have had an upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of Coumadin .
An outpatient gastrointestinal workup may be indicated .
6. RENAL :
The patient maintained her baseline creatinine which reflects chronic renal insufficiency secondary to her diabetes .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was treated on Unasyn for concern of cellulitis .
The patient &apos;s lower extremities were bilaterally erythematous consistent with chronic venous stasis .
However she did have a low grade temperature to 100F and it was thought that given her diabetes and ulcer on her heel she should be covered for possible cellulitis .
She will be discharged on a one week course of Augmentin .
The patient was discharged to her chronic care facility on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/27</PHI>/99 in stable condition .
1. Albuterol nebs 2.5 mg po q4h as needed .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">08/19</PHI>/96
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">12/03</PHI>/96
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Sepsis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
End-stage renal disease ; diabetes mellitus ; necrotizing fasciitis of the right leg and pelvis ; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ; hypertension ; asthma ; atrial fibrillation ; peripheral vascular disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">8/22</PHI>/96 , drainage of intraabdominal abscess .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">8/21</PHI>/96 , incision and drainage of right thigh .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">9/3</PHI>/96 , transverse colostomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Daie Elms</PHI> was a 50-year-old male , who underwent cadaveric renal transplant in 1992 , who presented with a three-week old scrape of the right popliteal fossa related to a prosthesis .
The wound became progressively indurated with drainage , and he presented for evaluation and treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ; hypertension ; peripheral vascular disease ; coronary artery disease ; bilateral vitrectomies ; cadaveric renal transplant ; suprapubic tube for ureteral necrosis ; status post right below-knee amputation and left below-knee amputation ; asthma ; atrial fibrillation ; left arm arteriovenous fistula .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Cyclosporin A .
Prednisone .
Procardia .
Digoxin .
Pravachol .
Imuran .
Lasix .
Epogen .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an obese man in no acute distress .
His blood pressure was 174/60 ; temperature 103.4 .
The chest examination was remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally , with regular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination .
Extremity examination revealed bilateral below-knee amputations with a 2 x 4 centimeter area of inflammation in the right popliteal fossa with a draining sinus .
Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
At the time of admission , BUN and creatinine were 89 and 4.4 ; white blood count 19.3 ; hematocrit 21.9 ; PT 15.1 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Elms</PHI> was admitted to the hospital , and after multiple cultures were drawn , he was subsequently taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/21</PHI>/96 for incision and drainage of a right thigh abscess .
Cultures from his abdomen subsequently grew out methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas .
His clinical condition continued to worsen with evidence of ongoing sepsis and renal failure , which transiently improved on hemodialysis , but generally progressively worsened .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/3</PHI>/96 , he underwent a transverse colostomy to allow diversion from the nonhealing leg and pelvis wounds .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
His nutrition remained poor throughout this time in spite of numerous attempts at enteral alimentation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/26</PHI>/96 , the patient had a hypotensive bradycardic arrest at the end of a dialysis run .
He was intubated at this time and could not be extubated thereafter .
He became increasingly more unresponsive and remained quite septic and febrile , resistant to aggressive antibiotic treatment .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
Over the next two days , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Elms</PHI> was kept comfortable and given intravenous fluids and tube feeds , but he remained extremely ill .
He had no spontaneous cardiac or neurologic activity at this time , and he was declared dead at 12:15 A.M. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/96 .
The family was notified , but declined a postmortem examination .

She also has had a cough for the past several years which is worse in the wintertime and is non-productive .
She denies hemoptysis , orthopnea , or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She complains of ankle swelling for the past several months .
Because of her worsening symptoms , the patient had an echocardiogram at an outside hospital in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Chogejuan St.ver , New Hampshire</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of l989 which showed mitral stenosis .
She is now referred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for evaluation of her mitral valvular disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
There is no history of rheumatic heart disease recalled by the patient , removal of benign lump in the left breast .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. ( this was discontinued one week prior to admission ) , Digoxin 0.25 mg q.d. , Mevacor 20 mg q.d. , Propranolol 20 mg q.d. , and Penicillin for dental procedures .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotekoorsner</PHI> is a very pleasant woman who appears her stated age and is in no acute distress .
Vital signs showed that she had a blood pressure on the right which was l80/ll0 and a blood pressure on the left arm which was l84/ll0 , her pulse was 90 and was irregularly irregular , and her respirations were l6 per minute and were unlabored .
Unremarkable .
LUNGS :
Clear to auscultation and percussion .
CARDIAC :
Carotid arteries showed normal upstroke and volume without bruits bilaterally .
There was jugular venous distention to l7 cm at 45 degrees .
The point of maximal impulse was at the fifth intercostal space in the mid clavicular line .
There was a left parasternal lift .
There was a loud Sl and a physiologically split S2 with a prominent P2 component .
There was an opening snap immediately following the P2 .
There was a diastolic rumble at the apex which radiates to the axilla which is graded as a I / VI .
There was also a I / VI apical systolic murmur .
There was no evidence of edema in the extremities .
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , and there was a slight right upper quadrant fullness .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
However , there was evidence of subtle mental status change on the evening after the patient &apos;s valvuloplasty .

His neck was supple .
Rales at the right base , bilateral decreased breath sounds at the bases .
Cor :
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no extra heart sounds , abdomen distended with an epigastric mass noted , mildly tender to palpation , no guarding .
Bowel sounds were present .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :

EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 107 beats per minute .
Evidence of old left anterior septal infarct .
Chest X-ray :
Large left ventricle , bilateral atelectasis or effusion .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan :
Pancreatitis , fluid collection in the lesser sac .
Gallbladder was visualized with stones .
IN SUMMARY , the patient was considered to have severe necrotizing pancreatitis , with severe cardiac disease .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/17</PHI>/95 , GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
An echocardiogram was done .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
The fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/28</PHI>/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/27</PHI> .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
Approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .
The computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .
Because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/28</PHI>/95 .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
Drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .
He remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .
Thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/15</PHI>/95 .
The patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew Candida albicans .
The patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .
He remained stable from a cardiac fashion .
He did have problems with po intake .
He had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .
He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
By the end of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , it became clear that Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .
The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .
Multiple discussions were held between Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mass</PHI> , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient &apos;s wife , with this same result .
After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Douet</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
MEDICATIONS :
1. Heparin , 5,000 units , sc. , b.i.d.
2. Lisinopril , 20 mg. , po , qD .
3. Isordil , 10 mg. , po , t.i.d.
4. Nitropaste , 1 inch to chest wall , q8h.
The patient has an ostomy appliance around the former site of his pancreatic fistula drain .
This area has continued to drain and it is felt that it could be best managed by an ostomy appliance and stoma care .
The patient is also treated with shots of morphine for intermittent pain .

DEATH
SUMMARY PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
DUODENAL PERFORATION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 60 year-old gentleman with a past medical history of gastric lymphoma status post total gastrectomy / splenectomy in 1991 with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction .
The patient noted onset of diffuse abdominal pain , periumbilical and epigastric in nature , nausea and vomiting and back pain starting at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission , <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/00 .
The patient denies fevers , chills or sweats , shortness of breath or chest pain .
He had a normal bowel movement the day prior to admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
History of small bowel obstruction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/17</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/15</PHI> , pancytopenia , history of right renal calculus .
Splenectomy , total gastrectomy as above , for gastric lymphoma for which he also received chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Epogen and Vitamin B 12 injections .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
White blood cell count 4.5 , hematocrit 31.9 , creatinine 1.1 .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 65 , blood pressure 101/74 , 100 percent oxygen saturation on room air .
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , nontender .
No hernias .
The patient did have right costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted after placement of a nasogastric tube and was brought emergently to the operating room after a CT scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .
There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .
There was no evidence of perforation on the CT scan .
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .
This was taken down and the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .
There was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .
However by the mid morning of the <PHI TYPE="DATE">14th of March</PHI> , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .
The patient was invasively lined with a Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .
At this point the patient &apos;s creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for the prospect of sepsis given his neutropenia and previous splenectomy and then an echocardiogram was performed to assess left ventricular function .
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .
The Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/14</PHI>/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .
Upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .
However prior to this it was also noted that the patient &apos;s scrotum was necrotic .
An incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .
Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .
In the abdomen the patient &apos;s retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled-off .
The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .
Upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic-like picture and was maintained on Neo-Synephrine .
He was hydrated vigorously .
It should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have a pancreatitis by enzymes .
This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .
The patient &apos;s urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .
therefore the patient went back to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/15</PHI>/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .
Further debridement was undertaken .
The patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .
The patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16</PHI>/00 the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .
Unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .
The patient &apos;s family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16</PHI>/00 .

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS :
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient recently DC&apos;d to home from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Erdiconre Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20</PHI>/2004 .
The patient reports feeling increasingly weak times several days and on the morning of admission needed assistance to go to the bathroom where he had a melanotic stool .
Of note , the patient has had melena times months with multiple blood transfusions at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Usoak Rinix Hospital</PHI> .
The patient , after having his melanotic stool , had a question seizure-like activity with question loss of consciousness .
EMS was called and found the patient &apos;s fingerstick blood sugar to be 24 .
The patient at that time had slurred speech with altered mental status .
The patient at the site was given 1 amp of D50 .
Fingerstick blood sugar on repeat was 190 .
The patient was transferred to the ED .
Of note , in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Genearocktemp Ry Health</PHI> ED the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 23.7 down from low 30s , a troponin of 5.8 , and an EKG with afib showing peak T-waves .
At that time the patient was thought to have non ST elevation MI ; however , family declined aggressive cardiac intervention and opted for medical management only .
Thus , the patient was admitted to the Medical Service for GI workup including possibly EGD .
Of note , the patient had a previously scheduled EGD for <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/17</PHI> .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. Cardiovascular :
Ischemia :
The patient was managed on a beta blocker .
Aspirin was held second to his concurrent GI bleed .
Pump :
The patient was initially hydrated on exam ; however , the patient became euvolemic after transfusion of blood and _____ IV fluids .
Of note , the patient was transfused for a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells during this admission .
Lasix was given after each unit of packed red blood cells .
Repeat echo revealed an EF of 45-50% with inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis .
Rate and rhythm :
The patient with a history of afib .
Afib was stable .
Coumadin and aspirin are held again secondary to his concurrent GI bleed .
2. GI :
A GI consult was obtained and the patient had adequate IV access .
Hematocrit was checked q.8h and the patient was transfused again , as noted above , a total of 4 units packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of less than 30 .
The patient was started on Protonix IV 40 b.i.d.
Per GI consult given the patient &apos;s non ST elevation MI he would be a high risk candidate for a GI endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non ST elevation MI period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective GI workup in 4-6 weeks .
The patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but no evidence of bright red blood per rectum or large amounts of melena .
On the date of discharge the patient has stools that are only trace guaiac positive .
3. Endocrine :
On admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
The patient &apos;s fingersticks were in the 150s without any coverage .
The patient was restarted on a low dose glipizide at 2.5 mg and adjustments to be made at the next PCP visit .
4. Heme :
Over the last several days the patient received a total of 4 units packed red blood cells during this admission .
On discharge his hematocrit is 35.4 .
5. ID :
6. Pulmonary :
The patient with a history of MRSA left lower lobe pneumonia .
We have a low threshold for starting antibiotics ; however , chest x-ray reveals no acute changes and the patient remained 96% on room air throughout this admission without any stigmata over recurrent pneumonia including cough , dyspnea or shortness of breath .
7. Renal :
The patient came in with a creatinine that was elevated at 2.6 .
On discharge his creatinine is 1.8 .
CODE STATUS :

LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission included a sodium of l4l , a chloride of l06 , a potassium of 4.3 , a bicarbonate of 26 , and a BUN of l0 .
Creatinine was 0.8 and glucose was 96 .
Otherwise , the SMA 20 was within normal limits .
White count was 5.5 , hematocrit was 43.5 , and MCV was 9l .
Platelet count was 350,000 .
Differential included 66 polys , 24 lymphocytes , 3 monocytes , and l eosinophil .
Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of l.0l5 , a pH of 8.0 , l+ ketones , and no blood .
Chest X-Ray showed hyperinflation bilaterally and loss of the anterior clear space on the lateral film likely secondary to arm position since the patient was unable to raise up her arm from weakness stemming from her multiple sclerosis .
EKG showed baseline artifacts , sinus tachycardia at l05 , PR interval of 0.l6 , QRS of 0.08 , QT of 0.36 , an axis of 60 degrees , poor R wave progression with transition after the V4 lead , T wave flattening in II and F , and T wave inversion in III .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Multiple sclerosis - The patient underwent lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an IgG to albumin ratio of 0.485 .
Cell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one .
Patient also had an MRI scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis .
SPEP showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits .
The patient underwent <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital</PHI> multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .
She tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .
This was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .
She received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .
2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point .
She had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis .
Work-up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .
Haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal LDH .
Glucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge .
This was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .
Patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .
A clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .
She did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .
Patient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , and the <PHI TYPE="DATE">Septemberth of 2006</PHI> to assure that her hematocrit recovers .
3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/15</PHI>/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
Subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .
Patient received a seven day course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .
Her Foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">02/28</PHI>/97
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatitis B-related cirrhosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Tuberculosis in childhood .
(2) Hepatic encephalopathy .
(3) Grade I esophageal varices .
(4) Hepatic hydrothorax on the right .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Repeated pleurocentesis .
Chest tube placement on the right .
Endotracheal intubation .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 60-year-old Mandarin speaking gentleman , with a long history of end-stage liver disease secondary to Hepatitis B. infection diagnosed approximately six years prior to admission , who now presents with recurrence of right-sided hydrothorax thought to be related as an ascitic equivalent on the right side .
The patient has been admitted multiple times with this symptom , and in this setting , was called in to the hospital by his primary care doctor on the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath , and dyspnea on exertion .
He was admitted to the Medical Service where he was found to have a transudative , right-sided effusion thought again to be the equivalent of his ascites on the basis of end-stage liver disease .
It was tapped and drained with placement of a chest tube .
The patient was evaluated by the Liver Transplant Service , and on the end of his first week of admission , became increasingly somnolent with exam findings consistent with evolving hepatic encephalopathy .
This change in mental status remained refractory to medical management , and in the setting of recurrent spiking fevers and worsening renal function , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">17th of February</PHI> , 1997 .
In the Intensive Care Unit , his chest tube continued to have massive volume output , and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid .
He has not been considered as a candidate for a TIPPS or for pleurodesis , given his position at the top of the transplant list for his blood type , B .
Early in his Intensive Care Unit admission , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Hibbslires</PHI> was intubated and ventilated , placed on broad antibiotic coverage including Vancomycin , Fluconazole , Ceftazidime , and Flagyl .
His renal function continued to worsen and he developed hypervolemic hyponatremia , and hemodynamic parameters consistent with sepsis .
During the first week of <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> in spite of antibiosis , the patient developed worsening renal failure , became anuric , and developed rapid progression in spite of his chest tube of the right-sided hydrothorax in addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome vs. extreme volume overload .
He became dependent on pressers .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th of February</PHI> , the patient had an extremely large volume gastrointestinal bleed , and worsened hepatic encephalopathy .
In consultation with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leynslentnerswaimjesc</PHI> and with his gastrointestinal physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Loydbreunlinke</PHI> , and with the patient &apos;s family , the decision was made in the setting of his grim prognosis and multiple morbidities that further aggressive treatment would not be pursued .
The patient was evaluated for continuous venous venous hemodialysis , which in the end in the setting of the family &apos;s wishes , was not begun with this patient .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th of February</PHI> , the patient succumbed to overwhelming sepsis and anuric renal failure , and hypervolemia .
The time of death was 5:16 A.M. on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th of February</PHI> , 1997 .
The family was present .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leynslentnerswaimjesc , Lau</PHI> , and <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Launtburce</PHI> were notified .

Discharge Date :
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1) RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY PSEUDOMONAS CELLULITIS .
2) PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION .
3) CORD COMPRESSION .
4) STEROID INDUCED DIABETES MELLITUS .
5) PLASMACYTOMA .
6) POOR NUTRITIONAL STATUS .
7) THROMBOCYTOPENIA STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .
8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
A workup done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">DE</PHI> is not available at the time of this dictation .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 to <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/94 .
He has been on Decadron since <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .
He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/20</PHI>/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .
There was evidence of cord compression .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Huyychestleme Health Of</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Scoo , Utah</PHI> where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lorough Medical Center</PHI> &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Multiple myeloma .
2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .
4) Chronic renal insufficiency .
5) Chronically low platelet count .
6) Failed autologous bone marrow transplant in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>/92 .
7) Hypothyroidism .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Positive for diabetes mellitus .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Married to a very supportive wife .
ALLERGIES :
Question of penicillin and sulfa drugs leading to a rash .
MEDICATIONS :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission showed a non-toxic appearing male with temperature 99.5 , blood pressure 82/50 , heart rate 118 , respiratory rate 15 .
HEENT exam atraumatic , no oral lesions .
Neck supple , carotids without bruits .
Cardiac exam was regular S1 and S2 , no murmur .
Chest clear to auscultation with a few fine crackles at the left base .
Abdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
Rectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .
Extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .
There was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .
Strength was decreased in both lower extremities .
Coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .
PT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .
Magnesium 1.7 .
UA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .
Chest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
There was no CSF density .
These findings were consistent with the cord compression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/25</PHI>/94 .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/28</PHI>/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/94 .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

UNIT NUMBER :
<PHI TYPE="ID">282-52-89</PHI>
ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">08/05</PHI>/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
urinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , Parkinson &apos;s disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> with a fever .
He reports lower abdominal pain x&apos;s 2 days .
Of note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his Parkinson &apos;s disease .
His wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 .
They went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for admission .
He was recently started on a Texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home .
He has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
MEDICATIONS ; On admission were Eldepryl , Artane , Prilodol , Sinemet and Opuputine .
ALLERGIES :
He had no known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .
He was continued on his Parkinson &apos;s medications .
A head CT was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .
Head CT results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Factor</PHI> agreed he would review the CTs and follow the patient while in house .
He was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms .
He was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .
The patient &apos;s mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Arnsperni Health</PHI> services .
Bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration .
He did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued .
Thus , he was considered ready for discharge .
He again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated .
He again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .
He was switched over the Clinda and Gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/10</PHI>/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic .
He was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .
He was hypotensive into the 80s .
An electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased ST segment and left anterior ST depressions .
RV leads were negative for ST elevation .
A chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .
A portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .
Anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .
He had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .
The right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery .
The patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .
He was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .
He was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on Dobutamine for pressure support .
He was diuresed with Lasix and Diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated .
He was dynamically stable on his Dobutamine with improved oxygenation .
The patient continued fairly stable while intubated .
Two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of Dobutamine .
He had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .
His neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .
Discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities .
They were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction .
An echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus .
The lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .
Discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .
He was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .
The patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .
No further blood draws were done .
The patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous Morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .
Comfort measures continued until the day <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 , where Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Koteleebdils</PHI> was found to be pulseless , without respirations .
He was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 .
The family and the attending physician were notified .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Rule</PHI> is a 75 year old woman who is status post sigmoid resection for Duke &apos;s C2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/8</PHI>/96 with abdominal pain and neutropenia .
She first presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1990 with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke &apos;s B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .
She then represented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1996 with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .
She underwent a sigmoid resection on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/17</PHI>/96 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenni Pain</PHI> .
At the time of surgery there was no evidence of liver disease .
Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .
One of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .
She was therefore staged Dukes C2 .
An abdominal CT scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .
A chest x-ray was read as clear .
She is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .
She presented to the Hematology / Oncology Clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/5</PHI>/96 for evaluation of possible adjuvant chemotherapy .
She began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .
She was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aacent Slentjae</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Linatpromehack Worth Hospital</PHI> for Radiation Therapy .
She began treatment on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/20</PHI>/96 .
She subsequently had three days of IV bolus 5-FU chemotherapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">June 25th</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th</PHI> of 1996 , which she tolerated well .
Her course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> .
She had unremarkable lumbosacral films , except for degenerative joint disease .
An MRI was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/25</PHI>/96 to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .
However , they were unable to rule out a soft tissue abnormality at L5 encroaching on a neural foramen .
She presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/8</PHI>/96 with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .
She denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in 1992.
(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .
Cardiac catheterization showed sequential LAD and she underwent angioplasty twice to the LAD with good results .
An echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 1994 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% .
Her baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block .
(3) Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
(4) Osteoporosis .
(5) Hypercholesterolemia .
(6) History of herpes zoster .
(7) Status post appendectomy .
(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
A KUB performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .
However , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .
This was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .
These findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .
She was admitted and made NPO .
On admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 .
She was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
Her ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .
She was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .
She was also placed on neutropenic precautions .
She continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs .
However , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/18</PHI>/96 she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued .
She was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on TPN .
Of note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .
Of note , shortly after starting on her TPN her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and TPN was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .
She was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
We recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .
During this time she will continue to receive TPN .
After that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .
Her small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Insulin sliding scale b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day , Neutra-phos 500 mg p.o. q. day , metopromide 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets one sublingually q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , nizatidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea , nafcillin dose 4 mg in 24 hours , and TPN .
Make sure her TPN at this point is 6% amino acids and 15% dextrose and 400 kilo calories of lipids , total volume is 1.6 liters and it is to be administered over 20 hours .
In addition to the above , she has the following additives :
20 mm/liter of potassium phosphate , 30.8 mEq per liter of potassium chloride , 30 mEq per liter of sodium chloride , 8 mEq per liter of magnesium sulfate , 94 ng per liter of calcium , 10 ml per day of multivitamins , 10 mg of vitamin K every Monday , 1 ml per day of trace elements , and 22 units of Regular insulin .
Therefore , her total potassium is 60 mEq per liter , total sodium is 30 , and total phosphate is 20 .
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Rule</PHI> is to follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Chelkjescchalsere</PHI> , who can be reached at <PHI TYPE="PHONE">148-701-5440</PHI> .

1. Prostate cancer .
2. Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient is an 87-year-old male with stage D prostate was cancer , was admitted for fluid hydration on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">10th of March</PHI> .
The patient was initially diagnosed with prostate cancer in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 1989 .
He presented with gross hematuria at that time .
Subsequent prostatic biopsy revealed a Gleason &apos;s IV , plus V tumor and the CT showed an irregular large prostate with tumor invasion into the bladder and evidence of bilateral retroperitoneal lymph node spread .
There was also evidence of bone metastasis at that time .
The patient was admitted in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1991 for urinary retention and acute renal failure and was treated with fluid rehydration and Foley catheter placement .
Over the past one month prior to admission , the patient &apos;s wife has noticed a marked decrease in p.o. intake and also noted a weight loss of approximately ten pounds in the preceding two weeks .
The patient has been lethargic and bed ridden for the past two weeks , although there was no evidence of fever or chills over this time .
As above .
MEDICATIONS :
None currently .
None .
HABITS :
No history of cigarette smoking .
The patient is afebrile with a recumbent blood pressure of 128/16 , pulse of 76 , and standing blood pressure of 110/60 with a pulse of 88 .
Respirations are unlabored at 16 .
HEENT :
Noted for nonicteric sclerae and lungs that are clear to auscultation .
No CVA tenderness was appreciated in the heart and the heart appears to be in regular rate and rhythm .
EXTREMITIES :
Without cyanosis or edema .
ABDOMEN :
Soft and nontender .
SKIN :
Decreased turgor with dry mucous membranes .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count of 7.75 , hematocrit of 46.2% , sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , creatinine 25 , and BUN was 1.4 with a blood sugar of 88 .
Urinalysis demonstrated 30-50 white blood cells with red blood cells too numerous to count and 2+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of prostate CA , for fluid rehydration .
Initially , the patient was begun on Bactrim for presumptive urinary tract infection and the initial course of his hospitalization , he took p.o.&apos; s poorly .
The patient remained afebrile , however , and his electrolytes were within normal limits .
By hospital day number six , however , the patient became febrile to 100.7 and repeat urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells and 1+ bacteria .
Antibiotics were switched to IV Ciprofloxacin and the patient defervesced ; however , by hospital day number seven , the patient was found to be passing very little urine through his condom catheter and electrolyte screen and electrolytes from hospital day number seven showed a BUN of 27 and a creatinine of 2.7 .
The patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated ; however , by hospital day number nine , BUN was 22 , creatinine was 3.5 .
A Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine .
Subsequently , the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day .
Blood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 .
The patient &apos;s fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 .
The patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 .
Gradually over the course of the following days , the patient &apos;s electrolytes again normalized ; however , as the patient continues to take p.o.&apos; s poorly , the patient remained on IV hydration therapy .
On hospital day number fourteen , electrolytes were sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 .
The patient was taking 470 cc of liquid p.o. and is now in stable condition and ready for transfer to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">El Hospital</PHI> to continue his recovery .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">El Hospital</PHI> , still receiving IV hydration at a rate currently of 50 cc an hour of D5 one-half normal with 20 mEq of K .
Should the patient &apos;s p.o. intake drop to below 500 , the patient should be hydrated at 75 cc/hour .
If the patient &apos;s p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day , the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour .
The Foley catheter was in place and the Bacitracin ointment should be applied to the urethral meatus twice a day .
Periodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection .
It should be noted that while in the hospital , the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer .
The patient is discharged on Mylanta 30 cc with meals , Carafate 1 gm q. 6 , Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until the patient regains full activity and IV hydration .
The Foley should be in place until a follow-up appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aarhalt</PHI> can be scheduled in approximately one to two weeks at which time a decision regarding the status of the patient &apos;s urinary obstruction will be addressed .

Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained PMI which was located in the left mid clavicular line , S1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .
It radiates to both carotids bilaterally .
There was also a blowing holosystolic murmur heard at the patient &apos;s apex to axilla .
There was no S3 appreciated .
Abdominal examination revealed that the abdomen was soft , non-tender , non-distended , no organomegaly , no masses , normal active bowel sounds .
The patient &apos;s extremity examination was notable for erythema of the right calf with a small ulcer with a relatively clean base .
Neurological examination revealed that the patient was quite sedated at this time having received some medications .
She was arousable only to painful stimuli .
Her pupils were reactive bilaterally .
Her face was symmetric .
She had an intact gag reflex .
She was able to move all four of her extremities in response to pain .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Mental status changes :
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .
A neurologic work-up was undertaken which included a CT scan of the head which revealed no acute bleed and a lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 72 , protein 65 , white blood cell count 19 , red blood cell count 11,500 with no evidence of xanthrochromasia .
The Neurology Service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection , her multiple medications , or her metabolic condition .
The patient &apos;s mental status slowly began to recover , however on the morning of the first day of admission , <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 16</PHI> , 1998 , the patient was found after having fallen .
A neurological examination was performed which revealed no abnormality and imaging included a head scan which revealed no bleed and a cervical spine series which revealed degenerative joint disease but no obvious fracture .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 59 year old male with end stage renal disease from hypertensive nephrosclerosis .
He started on dialysis in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/92 and has been maintained on it since .
He is currently on eight times per week hemodialysis .
The patient is admitted for renal transplantation .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post left arteriovenous fistula creation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was unremarkable .
Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-8</PHI>-94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here-transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the <PHI TYPE="ID">EXWAGH9T</PHI> protocol .
His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .
He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
During this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .
An X-ray at the time revealed free air .
The patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .
He was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .
He therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
At the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .
A Holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .
The patient was seen in consultation and evaluated by Cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , Propanolol , and verapamil .
Again , he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .
He did have some postoperative hypertension which was controlled with Cardura and sublingual nifedipine prn .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prednisone 20 mg PO q.day , Imuran 25 mg PO q.day , Acyclovir 200 mg PO t.i.d. , Bactrim one single strength PO qhs , Maalox 15 cc PO b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Verapamil 80 mg PO t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg PO b.i.d. , Cardura 4 mg PO b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 300 mg PO b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg PO q.day , Clotrimazole 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Inderal 10 mg PO t.i.d.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gastric ulcer and gastric pericardial fistula , constricting pericarditis , adult respiratory distress syndrome , status post gunshot wounds and paraplegia since 1991 of T4 on down .
The patient has a Greenfield filter in .
He has multiple decubiti on his buttocks and penis .
He had a gastric pull up in 1992 of the stomach into the left thorax and he has a transverse colostomy and a sinus tract on the abdomen .
ALLERGIES :
Bactrim and Vancomycin .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Albuterol inhaler .
Amphotericin B 40 mg. qday .
Ceftazidime 1 gram intravenous q 8 .
Cisapride 10 mg. po. qid .
Dakin &apos;s solution 1/4 strength to ulcer of penis .
______________ capsule 1 po. tid .
Nystatin swish and swallow tid .
Percocet po. q4 to 6 prn .
Trazodone 50 mg. qhs. multivitamins 1 po. qd .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 25 year old who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a pericardial window .
He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer .
He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
It was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath .
The family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 4</PHI> , 1995 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Reg Cranka</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Win Shufffyfe</PHI> .
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
1. Neurologic and Psychologic :
The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression .
He is a paraplegic from T4 down .
The patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease .
2. Cardiac :
The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure .
He had a cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 1</PHI> , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 11</PHI> , 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% .
There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation .
There is trace pulmonary insufficiency .
The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 6</PHI> , 1995 .
The patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
The patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge .
The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal .
His medications for his respiratory system are Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
3. GI :
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy .
The patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 25</PHI> , 1995 .
This showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract .
There is no fistula seen .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Asha Vengloan</PHI> of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
The patient takes poorly his po. diet .
However he is able to swallow and tolerate po&apos;s .
He just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding .
The patient is able to tolerate po. medicines .
4. GU :
The patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes .
It has been noted to be improving .
The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes .
5. Skin :
The patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti .
Plastic Surgery was consulted Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ca Shuff</PHI> who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point .
These wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings .
The patient &apos;s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased .

TIME OF DEATH :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">5/19</PHI>/95 at 3:15 a.m.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> is a 59-year-old gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , alcoholic cirrhosis , and rectal cancer , who was scheduled for a resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the Medicine team for improvement of his heart failure .
He has a long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy , presumably due to alcohol .
He has mitral regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and an aortic valve area of 1.1 cm. squared with a peak gradient of 36 to 54 .
He has also had atrial fibrillation since 1990 , which has been rate controlled on Digoxin .
He was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon following an episode of bright red blood per rectum and 3.5-cm. sessile lesion at 27 cm. , which was biopsied through a colonoscopy , which revealed adenocarcinoma .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% .
Adenocarcinoma of the colon .
Cirrhosis .
Recurrent urinary tract infections .
Mitral valve regurgitation of 4+ .
Aortic stenosis .
Cellulitis and sepsis in 1992 .
Hyponatremia .
Peripheral vascular disease .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Lasix 40 mg. b.i.d. Tagamet 400 mg. b.i.d. Lisinopril 10 mg. q. day .
Digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfa medications .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His temperature was 99 .
Heart rate was 110 .
Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air .
He had jugular venous distention to the level of the jaw in the upright position .
His heart rate was irregularly with a 2/6 holosystolic murmur .
His chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one-halfway up the chest .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the Medicine Service and diuresed with Lasix and started on Captopril with the Lisinopril discontinued .
After many discussions between Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leickgrend</PHI> , the patient , and his family , concerning the severely high risk , given the patient &apos;s conditions , it was decided to proceed with the operation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/27</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .
His fluids were very strongly restricted , and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the Operating Room with 400 cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated .
He was taken to the Post-Surgical Intensive Care Unit , intubated and stable .
He continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator .
He was finally extubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/10</PHI>/95 , and despite respiratory rates in the 30s and very coarse , rhonchorous breath sounds , the patient continued to have acceptable oxygen saturation and acceptable blood gases on minimal oxygen .
His status , however , remained volatile , and in keeping his volume status somewhat on the dry side to optimize his pulmonary status , he became relatively oliguric and hypernatremic .
He required some fluid boluses with D-5-W to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/14</PHI>/95 , he returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for very aggressive pulmonary toilet .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/15</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Angio Suite for an attempted transhepatic internal jugular porta caval shunt .
His portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm. , going from 26 to 23 , so no shunt was placed .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/17</PHI> , he spiked a temperature to 103 with rigors and shaking chills .
His respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently .
At that time , multiple discussions were held with the family , and they decided to enact a Do Not Resuscitate order .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> &apos;s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine .
His urine output remained very low .
His white blood cell count rose to 22,000 with a 50% bandemia .
A Swan-Ganz catheter revealed an SVR of 350 , and he was started on Neo-Synephrine and Epinephrine prior to the Do Not Resuscitate order .
Throughout the day on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/18</PHI>/95 , his blood pressure continued to fall in the 80s , then 70s , then 60s , and at 3:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/19</PHI>/95 , despite multiple pressors , his blood pressure dropped down to 50 ; he then went into ventricular fibrillation , followed by flat line .
At that time , he had no spontaneous respirations and no audible heart tones .
He had no carotid pulses , no gag reflex , and no pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .
He was pronounced dead at 3:15 a.m.
The family was contacted and were present at his bedside .
A postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family .

OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Radiation therapy to the right clavicle <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/16</PHI>/2004 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">PUOMC</PHI> admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .
She had actually completed her five years of Tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch .
Not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement .
She had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness .
There had been no focal neurologic changes .
Up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease .
On admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on room air was 92% .
She did look mildly dyspneic .
Her lungs were clear .
She had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement .
She was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .
The rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 .
Bilirubin normal .
Her alk phos slightly up at 174 .
WBC 10.8 with normal differential .
Hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets 345,0000 .
A urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells .
A CA 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .
The patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of Zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .
She gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle .
This was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site .
She also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral MRIs to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression .
She had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of Physical Therapy .
A single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain .
Her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .
The sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks .
PLAN :
Escalate the doses of the Dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o&apos;clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on Remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional SSRI overlap until it seems to show more affect .
She lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .
The patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .
She was begun on Letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of Xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">First</PHI> &apos;s office to have further discussions of this later approach .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Zofran 8 mg p.o. q.8 p.r.n. nausea .
Doculax 5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n. Colace 100 mg b.i.d. Senna syrup two teaspoonfuls b.i.d. Mylanta 15-30 mg p.r.n. dyspepsia .
Multivitamin , Megace 200 mg p.o. q.d. ( appetite stimulant ) .
Nexium 20 mg q.d. Femora ( letrazole ) 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. Polyethylene glycol ( Miralax ) 17 gm p.o. q.d. Dilaudid 4 mg p.o. q.4 hours p.r.n. breakthrough pain .
Fragmin 5000 units subq b.i.d. Oxycodone controlled-release ( OxyContin ) 10 mg p.o. q.12 hours .
Dexedrine 5 mg p.o. at 8 a.m.
The patient was discharged in improved , stable , satisfactory condition with the expectation that she will call Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">First</PHI> &apos;s office for a followup visit in about two weeks .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 5 year old male with multiple anomalies transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Capa An- Medical Center</PHI> of <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/20</PHI> for management of airway obstruction secondary to tracheal stenosis / history of difficult intubations .
The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and intubations .
The patient first presented with stridor and respiratory distress on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/92 .
A bronchoscopy at that time showed a 50% tracheal stenosis .
Since then the patient has had intermittent episodes of stridor with agitation with upper respiratory tract infections .
The patient was taken to the emergency room where he was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy .
They were unable to get to the distal part of the trachea .
The patient was a difficult intubation and it was finally performed by a thoracic surgeon using a 3.5 endotracheal tube .
The patient was then hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Asney Ewood Health Care</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Losbroke Pringda Field Delp U</PHI> and maintained with Pavulon and Morphine .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> was consulted and the patient was transferred by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ton Len N&apos;ss Community Hospital</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and management by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/20</PHI> in the p.m.
The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health immediately prior to this hospitalization with no history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms , fever , cough , vomiting , diarrhea or decreased appetite .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Respiratory :
The patient remained intubated and maintained on a Pavulon and Morphine drip through until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/92 .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room where bronchoscopy was done .
The patient was also noted to have mild right mainstem bronchus stenosis too .
Very mild .
The patient had a 3-0 Shiley trach placed approximately 1 cm below the vocal cords .
The trach extends approximately 1 cm below the area of stenosis .
Chest X-Rays shows clear lung fields bilaterally with the trach tube noted to be in good position .
I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative .
There is one Gram stain that showed some polys but otherwise they have been unremarkable .
There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia that could have precipitated this event and all X-Rays have been unremarkable .
The patient has a history of significant hyperinflation of the chest with an increased AP diameter which is mildly improved after the tracheostomy .
Cardiac :
The patient is otherwise stable .
The patient had some evidence of doubled T waves on the day of arrival .
These T waves have since cleared and the patient is otherwise unremarkable .
Please note that the last arterial blood gases was Ph 7.40 , PCO2 of 41 , PO2 of 112 , bicarbonate of 25 .
Fluids and Nutrition :
The patient has presently been weaned over to his regular diet which is generally some crackers , cereal and occasional bits of food .
GI :
This was felt to be mild aspiration .
The patient also had episodes of frequent coughing .
Clinical examination shows no decreased breath sounds .
The repeat X-Ray is generally clear and the patient is generally in no distress .
The patient was made NPO on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/25</PHI> a.m. Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> &apos;s team is coming to evaluate the patient .
Recommendations include probable evaluation for aspiration of upper airway contents and possible G tube placement in the future .
The patient has a history of longstanding constipation generally requires an enema every couple of days .
The patient last received enema on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/24</PHI> in the p.m.
HEM :
His initial hematocrit was 31% .
His hematocrit on transfer was 33% .
The patient never received blood during the procedure .
The estimated blood loss was minimal .
Renal :
He has been stable here .
He is presently being weaned off his Phenobarbital and advanced onto Tegretol by his Neurologist in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Vanri , SC</PHI> .
Levels on arrival showed a Phenobarbital level of 25 , Tegretrol level of 3.1 .
The patient has had problems taking p.o. Tegretol during this hospitalization and levels need to be checked in the near future .
Phenobarbital has been maintained by intravenous 30 mg b.i.d.
Infectious Disease :
The patient arrived receiving ceftriaxone for one day down in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</PHI> .
The patient was switched over to Ancef to cover for Staph and usual flora for possible pneumonia .
The child only had a one time spike on pod 1 to 103 .
Three trach aspirates have all been unremarkable .
The blood cultures are unremarkable , sputum cultures are unremarkable , urinalysis was also negative .
The patient cannot be cathed as he has a recent hypospadias repair .
The patient is still being maintained on Ancef at the request of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> &apos;s team .
The patient will be transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ral Medical Center</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Saintarv</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/25</PHI>/92 by ambulance .
The patient has a 3-0 Shiley in place that is stitched to his neck and also has trach ties in places .
The trach appears to be quite stable and the patient is tolerating having his trach in quite nicely with a humidified mask .
The plans per ENT are that the patient &apos;s trach will not be changed for at least one months time .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> will contact Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Roosekote</PHI> as to probable plans .
It appears that Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> wants to re-evaluate the child in 4 to 6 weeks with another bronchoscopy and feels that possibly tracheal reconstruction may be possible at that time .

Discharge Date :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">06/22</PHI>/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC CERVICAL CARCINOMA .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Echocardiogram times two .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .
Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanor</PHI> .
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
On ultrasound in <PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .
She was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Weekscook University Medical Center</PHI> with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
She was therefore transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Emaciated white female in mild respiratory distress .
Temperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .
HEENT :
NECK :
No lymphadenopathy .
CHEST :
Few inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .
Well healed Pfannenstiel scars and no masses .
PELVIC :
No masses .
RECTAL :
No masses and guaiac negative .
EXTREMITIES :
No edema or cyanosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .
PT and PTT were 12 and 26 .
Electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was no evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/14</PHI> and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/11</PHI> .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/19</PHI> , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/20</PHI> .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/19</PHI> and Ifex and Mesna on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> .
She was noted , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/16</PHI> , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .
She was hooked up with support services in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961</PHI> for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/22</PHI>/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mielke</PHI> and home care services .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Premarin 0.625 q.d. , Proventil Inhaler two puffs q.i.d. , Beclovent four puffs b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , MS Contin 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Trilisate 750 mg p.o. b.i.d. , MS Elixir 100 mg p.o. q.2h. p.r.n. , Robitussin with Codeine 5 cc p.o. q.2h. , and home O2 two liters via nasal prong with increase to four liters as needed for symptoms p.r.n.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Esophageal carcinoma-metastatic .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Lymphangetic pulmonary carcinomatosis , dyspnea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Bronchoscopy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/23</PHI>/95 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Po</PHI> is a 53 year-old white male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who is admitted with a 10-day history of progressive dyspnea on exertion .
Briefly , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Po</PHI> presented in 1992 with dysphagia and a midesophageal mass that proved to be squamous cell carcinoma .
He received two cycles of neoadjuvant Cisplatin and 5-FU , followed by esophagectomy , followed by two cycles of adjuvant platinum/5-FU .
He was without evidence of disease until the <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of 1994 , when he developed an inferior vena cava thrombosis and CT scan revealed celiac axis adenopathy .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1994 , pulmonary disease , consistent with lymphangetic spread of tumor , was present .
Over the last 10 days , he has been bothered by progressive dyspnea on exertion .
He denies fevers , chills , hemoptysis , chest pain , nausea and vomiting , or diarrhea .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Remarkable for a history of ulcers .
2) Inferior vena cava occlusion .
3) Arthritis .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atrovent , Proventil , Azmacort , Serevent inhalers .
Coumadin , Tagamet , and Clarithromycin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , the patient is afebrile , tachypneic , and tachycardic .
Skin is pale .
He has total alopecia .
His neck is supple .
His lungs reveal diffuse wheezes , especially in the left chest .
The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory studies on admission included a BUN and creatinine of 14 and 1.4 , normal calcium , white count of 12,100 , hematocrit of 32 , platelet count of 319,000 .
PT was 19.8 seconds .
His three liter nasal prong blood gas revealed a PO2 of 63 , PCO2 of 47 , pH of 7.39 .
A chest X-ray revealed diffuse air space disease , particularly on the left .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnostic impression of probable progressive carcinoma with a potential component of bronchospasm .
However , there was the possibility that this represented an atypical pulmonary infection .
Hence , he went to bronchoscopy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jesclinke</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/22</PHI>/95 .
Bronchoscopy revealed clear airways without evidence of significant secretions .
A few days after bronchoscopy , his intravenous Bactrim was discontinued and he was treated with oxygen , steroids , and inhalers .
It was felt that there were no further chemotherapy options for this disease and he met with hospice therapy .
In addition , he was hypoxic throughout his admission , often with oxygen saturations in the high 80s despite five liters of supplemental oxygen .
This was accompanied with some anxiety , which was treated with intermittent morphine and Ativan .
The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Mar 30</PHI> , 1995 with hospice care .
His status is DNR .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tagamet , 800 mg. PO q.day ; five liters of supplemental oxygen ; Carafate , 1 gm. b.i.d. ; Ativan , 1 mg. SL q.4 p.r.n.

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Lump in anterior abdominal / groin area .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76-year-old female who has undergone a previous right axillary femoral bypass graft for left foot ischemia .
This was initially in 1993 , followed shortly thereafter by repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm with an aortobifemoral bypass graft .
The previous axillary femoral bypass graft was at that point ligated .
She reports approximately 48 hours prior to this developing pain in the right lower abdomen and groin and noticed a new onset of a lump .
She denies fever , chills or other abdominal pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The past medical history and past surgical history is significant for upper gastrointestinal bleed , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , history of hypertension , atrial fibrillation .
Prilosec , Lanoxin , Lescol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination reveals a thin woman in no acute distress .
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination is unremarkable .
Chest clear to auscultation .
Abdomen :
soft with a palpable , nonpulsatile mass in the right lower abdomen which measures approximately 3 centimeters x 3 centimeters .
The previous axillary femoral bypass graft is readily apparent in the subcutaneous tissue along the right .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Granrivern Call</PHI> is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
There was no definite clonic activity .
There was no known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .

SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 18</PHI> , 1996 .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 19</PHI> , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ria</PHI> in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CHORDOMA .
PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">1/22</PHI>/97 Right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor with laminectomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> is a 60 year-old man presented with a two year history with right neck pain .
An initial CT scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> , 1996 showed a right wedge skull base mass .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , 1997 he underwent cerebral angiography complicated by an embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia .
He was taken to the Intensive Care Unit .
A follow-up MRI showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke .
He was treated with aspirin .
Postoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received Gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a PEG was preformed .
Now preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing .
He is taking some liquids p.o. but also has G-tube feedings q.2h.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Status post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote .
DIET :
Jevity Plus one can q.12h. by G-tube , some liquids .
ALLERGIES :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin discontinued in two weeks prior to admission .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Denies use of alcohol and tobacco .
He is married and lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nebraska</PHI> , works as a car dealer , has four grandchildren .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Heart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 .
General :
This is a pleasant 60 year-old man whose distressed .
HEENT , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed right jaw incision , slight swelling right jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is no erythema .
Lungs are clear to auscultation .
Heart regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Abdomen G-tube intact , soft non-tender , active bowel sounds .
Neurological alert and oriented times three , speech is fluent although there is some difficulty of tongue movement .
Cranial nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right .
Strength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities .
Deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing .
Cerebella intact .
Gait steady .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jan 22</PHI> , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .
Postoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .
He was extubated on postoperative day number one .
His neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .
He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .
He was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .
He noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .
On postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .
He vomited once and had intermittent headaches .
A head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .
A culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .
He was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .
A video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .
Because of continuing complaints by Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .
He underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Feb 04</PHI> , 1997 .
After conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .
It was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .
His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .
His lumbar drain was removed after five days .
He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .
He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .
2) Jevity Plus one can q.2h.
He will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .
FOLLOW-UP :
Follow-up will be with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Sick</PHI> in one weeks time .
ADDENDUM
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> will be restarted on his preoperative Aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days .

DEATH SUMMARY
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION FOR LYMPHOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 61-year-old white man with a history of mediastinal lymphoma who was admitted for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
He underwent intensive chemotherapy and entered a complete remission .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/89 , he developed B symptoms and work-up revealed relapse in the mediastinum , retroperitoneum , and bone marrow .
He underwent salvage chemotherapy and again went into remission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for hypertension .
Right mastectomy for benign lesion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed the patient to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 80 .
Respirations were 16 .
His physical examination was noteable only for the following .
His lungs were clear .
Cardiac exam was normal .
Abdomen was benign .
The remainder of his physical examination was normal except for decreased vibration and position sense in the distal fingers and toes .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed a normal SMA-7 except for potassium of 3.1 .
His liver function tests showed a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 139 but was otherwise normal .
Hematocrit was 29.3 .
White blood cell count was 4.5 .
The remainder of his laboratory studies were normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
His initial hospital course was complicated by the following :
1. Fever and neutropenia :
The patient developed fever and neutropenia without any clear source .
Despite this , the fevers persisted until he no longer was neutropenic .
2. Renal occlusive disease :
Starting on approximately day 14 , the patient developed signs of renal occlusive disease with increasing bilirubin .
Multiple abdominal ultrasound revealed no biliary dilatation ; there was evidence of gallbladder polyps versus stones on one ultrasound .
Despite aggressive supportive care , the patient &apos;s liver pathology did not resolve and he continued to have progressive hepatic failure .
Towards the end of the hospitalization , his bilirubins were in the high 30&apos;s and low 40&apos;s .
3. Renal failure :
Despite aggressive attempts to maintain his intravascular volume , the patient &apos;s renal function progressively declined .
He received multiple transfusions with coloids , including red blood cells and albumin .
Despite maximal efforts with coloids , renal range dopamine and Lasix , the patient &apos;s creatinine continued to rise .
4. Respiratory :
Despite a very aggressive approach to his care , the patient continued to decline .
Therefore , in close discussion with the family , he was made DNR .
The patient &apos;s clinical situation continued to deteriorate and he died on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/9</PHI>/90 at 4:30 a.m.
An autopsy was refused .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Right nephrectomy .
2. Cadaveric renal transplant .
3. Acute thrombosis .
4. Transplant nephrectomy .
6. Hypertension .
8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
9. Hypercoagulable state .
10. Perforated viscus .
11. Abdominal abscesses .
12. Sepsis .
13. Respiratory failure .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .
These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/16</PHI>/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/06</PHI>/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .
The patient remained unstable .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/08</PHI>/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Less</PHI> continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Less</PHI> condition was irretrievable .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Cantsleddjesc</PHI> felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/16</PHI>/98 .

1. STAGE IV ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
2. STAGE III-C OVARIAN CANCER
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. STAGE IV ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
2. STAGE III-C OVARIAN CANCER
TREATMENTS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old gravida 0 with stage IV endometrial cancer and stage III-C ovarian cancer vs metastatic endometrial cancer for line 2 , cycle 1 chemotherapy .
The patient presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>-90 , with heavy bleeding per vagina .
D and C showed grade II-III adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Wellla Uxinny:mount Medical Center</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Com St. , Tton , Arkansas 32167</PHI> .
The patient underwent TAH / BSO , partial omentectomy at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CTMC</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>-90 .
At that time , tumor was found to be studding on the right diaphragm , gross tumor in the omentum and large bowel , tumor through the uterine serosa .
Pathology showed grade II-III papillary adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with squamous differentiation which was focally invasive and superficial myometrium .
The ovary showed papillary serous adeno with omental involvement consistent with an endometroid adenocarcinoma .
The question was whether or not whether she had two primaries vs metastatic endometrial cancer .
The patient underwent 6 cycles of CAP in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Pemrancetul Tonsst.</PHI> .
However , during the fourth cycle , Cytoxan was dropped .
Her CA-125 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6-27</PHI>-91 , was 249 and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-29</PHI>-91 , was 734 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>-92 , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Wellla Uxinny:mount Medical Center</PHI> with left leg DVT and started on Heparin therapy .
She was discharged from there on Coumadin therapy .
On admission , the patient has no complaints except anxiety .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Negative except as above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative except as above .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
The patient gets hives to aspirin and tomatoes also cause her hives .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The temp was 99.4 , BP 114/78 , pulse 128 and respirations 20 .
She was an anxious female , in no acute distress .
HEENT exam showed PERRLA , EOMI , oropharynx benign .
CV was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , positive bowel sounds , non tender , large , hard mass occupying the lower abdomen and left upper quadrant .
The extremities were non tender without edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , the sodium was 136 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 98 , CO2 20 , BUN 8 , creatinine 0.8 and glucose 94 , ALT 5 , AST 10 , LDH 166 , alkaline phosphatase 81 , total bili 0.6 , direct bili .3 , albumin 3.3 , calcium 8.8 and uric acid 3.1 .
She had CA-125 which was pending at the time of discharge .
Her hematocrit was 31.1 , WBC 11.6 and 151,000 platelets .
PLAN :
The patient is thus stage IV endometrial and stage III-C ovarian vs metastatic endometrial for line II , cycle I chemotherapy IFEX , MESNA and VP-16 .
The plan was for urinalysis q d.
With the history of DVT , we plan Coumadin and check her coags .
The patient was tachycardiac on admission and it was felt she was dehydrated and / or anxious at the time of her initial evaluation .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia and incomplete right bundle branch block .
When compared with ECG of <PHI TYPE="DATE">11-06</PHI>-90 , there was borderline criteria for anterior MI although the patient denied any chest pain at any point .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent chemotherapy on the following doses :
IFEX 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days , MESNA 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days continuous IV infusion .
She had VP-16 mixed with 250 cc IV fluid given over 1 hour each day for 3 days .
She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient &apos;s urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .
A repeat straight cath was negative for RBC&apos;s .
After 1 day of chemotherapy , the patient had 8-10 RBC&apos;s in her urine but by the second day of her IFEX infusion , she had 50-80 RBC&apos;s in her urine as well as a few transitional epithelial cells .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
She did receive her VP-16 without complication .
Other significant issues were the patient &apos;s hematocrit on admission at 31.1 which dwindled down to 26.2 by <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-10</PHI> .
The patient was counselled and received 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s at that time .
However , the patient &apos;s hematocrit bumped only to 28.1 and a repeat later on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-11</PHI> , showed hematocrit of 27.6 .
At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 .
Her repeat on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-8</PHI> , was 36.0/68.2 and her Coumadin was held .
She received no Coumadin during her admission and by the time of discharge , her PT was down to 16.2 .
She was restarted on Coumadin 2.5 mg per day .
Her PT on the day of discharge was 13.2 and she was started on Coumadin 2.5 mg po q d as mentioned .
The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-12</PHI>-92 , with the approval of her attending physiciana , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Porriede Friednantflirt</PHI> .
FOLLOW UP CARE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-28</PHI>-92 , the patient will return for chemotherapy and she will follow up with her primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jescspald</PHI> , for repeat PT and Coumadin dosing on Monday , <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-14</PHI>-02 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Laymie Fournier</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leebjescobe</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia</PHI> who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center</PHI> .
He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .
A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He was started on aspirin .
He was also placed on Vasotec .
A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
A thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Head , neck :
unremarkable .
Lungs clear .
Carotids normal .
Cardiac :
Loud S4 and a II / VI regurgitant murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Nonfocal .
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 243 .
Cholesterol 197 , triglycerides 118 , HDL 31 , LDL 142 , total protein 6.2 , bilirubin 1.0 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , SGOT 23 .
Hematocrit on admission was 43% with a white blood count of 6600 .
MCV was 85 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .
This lowered with IV nitroglycerin .
He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
The situation was reviewed with his wife , <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Sligh</PHI> .
She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Leigh</PHI> and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .
It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .
He developed epigastric pain on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/31</PHI> which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Slusslashgodle</PHI> , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/02</PHI>/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Thorebreutz</PHI> took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He had good hemodynamics .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/05</PHI> it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .
He had a right bundle branch block .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew</PHI> .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
coronary artery disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Ischemic cardiomyopathy , orthotopic heart transplantation , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , coronary graft disease , medical noncompliance .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac echocardiogram .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Vessels</PHI> is a 49-year-old man status post orthotopic heart transplantation in 1991 at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dautenorwe Stuart Erec Hillpa Of Hospital</PHI> who is admitted with dyspnea and severe heart failure .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Vessels</PHI> &apos;s postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so .
Recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis .
A biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils .
He was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil .
Chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly .
Prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure .
An echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection .
Notable for coronary artery disease , coronary allograft vasculopathy , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease , CMV infection , hypertension , depression , and tricuspid regurgitation .
Examination revealed a tired , fatigued man with cool extremities .
His blood pressure is 130/80 and heart rate was 100. jugular venous pressure was increasing .
Carotids were 2+ .
There was a left ventricular heave and an S3 galop .
The abdomen was soft and nontender with a palpable liver edge and the pulses were diminished .
LABORATORY DATA :
Revealed a sodium 136 , potassium 4.5 , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 , glucose 136. hematocrit 40% .
The electrocardiogram revealed poor R wave progression and marked decrease in all volts .
chest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary vessels and enlarged heart .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed .
The echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction .
Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy .
At 4:30 AM the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest .
Despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated .
The rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure .
There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions .
A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure .
In total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate .
The resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 AM and were begun at 3:38 AM .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 63 year old patient who had no significant medical history until 1987 , when he developed a left arm embolism which was treated with SVG from the left thigh .
The postop course was uncomplicated with an embolus occluding the graft and a CVA .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">04</PHI>-90 , the patient suffered an intestinal embolism requiring an ileostomy which was closed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>-90 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>-90 , the patient developed a second CVA presenting with slurred speech which resolved without residual .
The patient presents now with a 3 month history of dizziness and mood changes .
He also complains of continued left arm paresthesias .
The patient also reports that he had a large silent MI in <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>-89 , which was uncomplicated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission to the Medical Service , the patient underwent work up for embolism source and source for his dizziness .
His search had previously been negative .
This finding was in concurrence with findings of a cardiac cath performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-12</PHI>-92 .
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Service for the removal of this left ventricular mass .
Coronary angiography during the cardiac cath had revealed normal coronaries without coronary artery disease .
After the usual preparation , the patient was taken to the OR on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-14</PHI>-92 , and underwent left ventriculotomy and removal of the left ventricular thrombus .
The pathological examination of the removed material revealed a blood clot with thrombus .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
During the early postop period , he was kept on IV Dextran and was restarted on Coumadin .
His further postop course was complicated by a recurrent episode of dizziness .
His neurologic work up , however , was negative .
A repeat echo showed no recurrent intraventricular thrombus and a carotid Doppler study was negative .
The patient suffered no further dizzy spells during the further postop days .
He was discharged in good condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-22</PHI>-92 .
DISPOSITION :
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
FOLLOW UP CARE :
Since our Hematology consultant recommended to keep the patient &apos;s PT in the range of 20-22 seconds , the patient will require close follow up of his PT&apos;s while on Coumadin .
This was discussed with the patient &apos;s local medical doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Royneo Walla</PHI> .
The patient will receive further follow up including evoked potential studies by our Neurology Service .
He has an appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">O Kotea</PHI> for his cardiac surgical follow up 4 weeks post discharge .

DIAGNOSIS :
RECURRENT CLEAR CELL OVARIAN CARCINOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The history of present illness and PAST MEDICAL HISTORY are unavailable , because there was no History and Physical on the chart .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included Synthroid .2 milligrams by mouth per day .
ALLERGIES are no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was not documented on the chart .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , hematocrit was 37 , baseline creatinine .9 .
postoperatively , her hematocrit fell to as low as 23.8 , for which she was transfused up to hematocrit of 33 and remained stable between 30 and 33 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to surgery on the day of admission , where she underwent exploratory laparotomy and a 5-centimeter tumor mass was identified , which was adherent and possibly intrinsic to the sigmoid colon , and also noted were firm and large periaortic lymph nodes bilaterally .
Because of these operative findings , only a biopsy was sent , which confirmed metastatic clear cell carcinoma , and further bowel surgery was not attempted .
Postoperatively , the patient &apos;s course was complicated initially by a falling hematocrit , which was transfused and then remained stable .
The she continued to have low-grade postoperative fevers until approximately 8 days postoperatively when her temperature spiked .
A pelvic ultrasound was obtained , which showed a large fluid collection in the pelvis .
This collection was tapped and found to be blood mixed with pus .
A drain was placed under ultrasound guidance and cultures were sent .
Cultures so far have grown suspected Pseudomonas from the liquid medium only , sensitivities are pending .
The patient was placed on ampicillin , gentamicin and Flagyl , and the fluid collection was drained over 4 days .
The drain was removed on postoperative day #12 .
The patient remained afebrile and antibiotics were stopped .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/04</PHI>/94 .
She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .
Patient also received AICD .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
Patient &apos;s past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
Since that time the patient has been treated medically .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">07</PHI>/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> .
Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .
Consequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .
Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .
Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
Furthermore , due to the patient &apos;s long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .
The patient did well at home until <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/31</PHI>/94 when she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Souland</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nixmont Bovo</PHI> with increasing congestive heart failure .
At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .
By report , in the interim since discharge from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
Dring this hospitalization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hahkellrick Hospital</PHI> , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .
She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .
She was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .
She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20</PHI>/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
The patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .
It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Alllo Eino Hospital</PHI> which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient &apos;s arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient &apos;s hospitalization without difficulty .
The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .
Consequently AICD placement was recommended .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 .
Note , from <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/22</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI> there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .
Consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .
Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .
Thus , AICD placement was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/10</PHI>/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .
It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Vonamemp , LA</PHI> via plane by herself .
This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Type II diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps .
ALLERGIES :

HOSPITAL COURSE :
As mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation .
As per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate .
An EPS study was performed which was negative for inducible arrhythmia despite maximal stimulus .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 .
Hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to AICD placement .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Wolfe-Parkinson White Syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay Memorial Hospital Of</PHI> for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .
His cardiac risk factors include :
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of chest pain and in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .
He subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .
He was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .
He underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Slusslashgodle</PHI> which were unsuccessful .
He was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/2</PHI>/98 he was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay Memorial Hospital Of</PHI> with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .
He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
He was discharged home but returned on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/13</PHI>/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .
He was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .
He denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .
Sotalol 160 mg bid .
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
NPH and CZI insulin .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
Lisinopril 10 mg bid .
Aspirin .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
ALLERGIES :
He reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .
There was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .
However , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
His lungs were clear throughout .
His apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .
His abdomen was benign .
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .
His creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .
His hematocrit was 49.3 .
His electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .
There were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .
Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .
He was seen by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nnoatal Hospital Center</PHI> who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .
Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/17</PHI>/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .
His right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .
He had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .
His left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .
The patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/20</PHI>/98 .
There was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .
Mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .
Radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .
There were no complications .
Following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .
He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .
In following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .
There were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .
He also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .
Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .
His Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .
After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .
His INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .
Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .
Accordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .
He did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .
Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .
Given his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .

Patient initially presented in 1991 with cervical lymphadenopathy , was treated with MACE / CytaBOM , and did well until 1997 , when he received six cycles of fludarabine for progressive disease .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> , 2001 , he progressed to leukemic phase , received Rituxan and CVP .
Started Campath in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> , 2001 , complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and CMV infection , and underwent MUD stem cell transplant in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> , 2002 .
The patient had bone marrow biopsy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> , 2003 , for persistent pancytopenia , revealing mild hypercelluarity with 80% leukemic cells .
He was again treated with Campath , had recurrent fever in association with sinus symptoms , with CT scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks .
Patient was hospitalized <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 26</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 11</PHI> for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head CT and MRI ) .
ID consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin , itraconazole , and pentamidine , with progression of skin infection .
Subsequent discontinuance of azithromycin , trial of 5-FC , with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance , change if itraconazole to voriconazole , given continued neutropenia , and trial of sulfadiazine , discontinued for increasing ARS .
Patient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole and IV pentamidine , with pentamidine nasal washings , with re-CT of sinuses near end of stay showing no change in disease burden .
He has had recurrent CMB infection in the setting of Campath therapy , requiring IV Foscarnet therapy during stay , with inability to tolerate valganciclovir maintenance suppression subsequently due to increasing ARS .
Hypercapture near end of stay was negative .
Patient experienced acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency , with previous baseline creatinine 1.6 , felt to be due to medication toxicity , requiring Kayexalate and Phoslo to manage electrolytes , but never any need for hemodialysis , with mild improvement of creatinine by discharge , with peak creatinine 3.4 , discharge creatinine 2.6 .
Patient struggled with GVHD , with extensive skin involvement , taking Cellcept , prednisone and cyclosporine at time of last admission .
Cellcept was discontinued in the setting of infection , but attempts to decrease prednisone or cyclosporine were unsuccessful .
Patient returns from rehabilitation after discharge on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 11</PHI> , with new fever up to 102.0 in DSCI clinic , increasing hepatomegaly as assessed by examination in clinic , and increasing creatinine .
Patient reports persistent mild right upper quadrant discomfort , recent poor appetite .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .
Workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report .
Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 20</PHI> , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
A repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 9</PHI> , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .
In the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba .
Pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .
Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 20</PHI> of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .
Idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .
However , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .
Most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
Patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 30</PHI> , a family meeting with patient &apos;s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Tomedankell Bile</PHI> , attending physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mellerny Close</PHI> , and house staff , was held to discuss patient &apos;s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
Decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient &apos;s comfort .
Pentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient &apos;s comfort .
DNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .
The patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .
Tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .
Such measures have been continued through <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 3</PHI> , and patient remains comfortable through this time .

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Tylenol #3 and metered dose inhalers PRN .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
HABITS :
65 pack year smoking history , denies alcohol abuse , however , strongly suspicious that the patient does drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a frail , cachectic woman in no acute distress .
Chest had diffuse crackles and rales with some end expiratory wheezing .
The abdomen was soft , non-tender , nondistended , flat with positive bowel sounds and functioning colostomy in the left lower quadrant with positive stool and gas in the bag .
Anoscope revealed a small 1 cm. laceration without active bleeding in the emergency room .
LABORATORY DATA :
Remarkable for sodium 139 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 98 , CO2 31.1 , BUN and creatinine 23/.9 respectively , white blood count 8 , hematocrit 31.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted from the emergency room to the floor and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells to bring up her hematocrit to approximately 36 .
On the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/3</PHI>/96 at 10:30 in the morning , the patient complained of some mild shortness of breath after infusion of her second unit of packed red blood cells .
Her sat was 94% which was down from her baseline of 96 , two liter nasal prong .
It was thought that she may have a touch of congestive heart failure secondary to transfusion .
Her intravenous fluids were held and her breathing was improved with upright posturing .
A chest x-ray showed clear lungs with respect to congestive heart failure .
Therefore the idea of pulmonary embolus was entertained although the patient had no episodes of tachycardia , chest pain or hemoptysis with her shortness of breath .
The lower extremity arterial non-invasive studies were obtained and were negative for deep venous thrombosis .
This provided adequate hemostasis .
The patient was then observed and discharged that evening on her normal regimen of pain medicine with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Arnsperni Health</PHI> support for assistance with activities of daily living .
The patient is end stage severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and advanced adenocarcinoma and is do not resuscitate .

The patient is a 40 year old male with a history of prior anterior myocardial infarction and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus who was transferred from an outside hospital after an episode of acute shortness of breath and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history four years ago of being admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital</PHI> after suffering an acute anterior myocardial infarction .
He had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed a three vessel coronary artery disease with an occluded RCA , 70%-80% proximal LAD , and a high grade left circumflex lesion after the OM with distal left circumflex occlusion .
The patient was subsequently medically management after this hospitalization and has done very well .
His most recent echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1996 showed an ejection fraction of 20% with a thin fibrotic septum with akinesis and moderately severe hypokinesis in all other regions except for the lateral wall .
The patient also had an electrocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1996 which was negative following , however was at a low workload .
The patient &apos;s was most recently admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Martin Luther King Day</PHI> after becoming acutely short of breath after a five minute walk .
He had no chest pain , palpitations , diaphoresis , or nausea .
He called the EMT &apos;s and was found to be in pulmonary edema by chest x-ray at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center</PHI> .
He was diuresed and ruled out for myocardial infarction .
His ECG showed no ischemic changes .
He was then transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus x 15 years with no retinopathy or foot lesions .

SOCIAL HISTORY :
He lives with his two brothers and is on disability .
He has a ten pack year history of smoking , quit in 1990 .
FAMILY HISTORY :
His mother and father both died secondary to myocardial infarction .
One of his brothers has had a myocardial infarction .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature 100.3 , heart rate 76 , blood pressure 100/78 , respiratory rate 16 , and an oxygen saturation of 96% on two liters .
NECK :
No jugular venous distention .
CHEST :
Clear to auscultation with no wheezes or rales .
CARDIOVASCULAR :
Regular rate and rhythm with no extra heart sounds and no murmurs .
ABDOMEN :
Benign .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 25 and creatinine 1.4 .
White count 6 and hematocrit 41.5 .
PT 14.1 with an INR of 1.4 , PTT 36.7 .
Urinalysis was negative .
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 63 with normal intervals .
He had flat T waves in I and aVL , which were unchanged from previous ECG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for further management of his pulmonary edema .
It was felt that the patient possibly had a worsening of his coronary artery disease and therefore underwent cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/17</PHI>/96 .
His coronary arteries revealed an 80% stenosis and a large OM .
The dominant left circumflex was occluded with left-to-left filling .
He also had a 50% LAD stenosis , a 100% large DT stenosis and a nondominant RCA with left RCA collaterals .
It was felt that this cardiac catheterization was not significantly changed from his previous catheterization .
Given his high right-sided filling pressure , he was started on Lasix for diuresis and his Captopril was increased for greater afterload reduction .
It was felt that the patient should have an augmented medical regimen and as an outpatient undergo an exercise tolerance test with viability evaluation to determine whether he would benefit from revascularization .
He was restarted on Coumadin for his low ejection fraction and started on diuresis with IV Lasix for two days and then switched to an oral Lasix regimen .
DISPOSITION :
He was discharged to home in stable condition and feeling well .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
EPIGLOTTITIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .
She was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .
She did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
She denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .
She was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .
He recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .
There was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .
Apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ez Ephtro Health Center</PHI> where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter , however , works at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> and therefore the family elected to bring the patient home and then bring her to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> .
She was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .
She did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .
She was febrile to 101.7 .
ENT consult was obtained .
A lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
ENT examination was then to be performed .
Chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .
Negative .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
None .
ALLERGIES :
None .
Smoking none .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
Alcohol none .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
She had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Oral cavity was normal .
Neck :
Revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass .
Neck :
Hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
The left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
The epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .
The patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .
There was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .
Lungs :
Clear .
Heart :
Regular rate and rhythm .
S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .
No masses .
Back :
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Revealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .
As noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
The chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
Due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .
She was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
At the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .
Her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
She had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .
She was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .
EKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .
She continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .
Her blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .
She was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .
She went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .
She continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .
She was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .
Examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .
Otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .
Of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .
Once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .
After extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
Again , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
O2 saturations looked good .
It was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .
She was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .
She was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .
Her white counts came down .
Blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .
She had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .
Nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .
DISPOSITION :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/9</PHI>/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .
Our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .
She , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
Discharge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .
The patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
EPIGLOTTITIS , QUESTION SECONDARY TO EPIGLOTTIC MALIGNANCY .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Cholangiocarcinoma , recurrent ; status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
1) Obstructive jaundice , secondary to recurrent tumor and / or stricture at the bile duct to jejunum anastomosis .
2) Subhepatic fluid collection , drained .
3) Clostridium difficile colitis with diarrhea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , replacement of permanent biliary stents and liver biopsy .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/24</PHI>/95 , percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/95 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/30</PHI>/95 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/95 , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 there were revisions and contrast injections to the biliary catheter drainage system .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> 1994 , he had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography that shoed obstruction at the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> 1994 , the Klatskin tumor was resected and it was shown to be moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma .
The surgical margins were positive and he was treated postoperatively with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
He was admitted in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1994 , for biliary drainage catheter placement and balloon dilatation of what was thought to be an anastomotic stricture .
Biopsies and fine needle aspirates were suspicious for recurrent cholangiocarcinoma .
Since that time he had been persistently jaundiced and fatigued , until three weeks prior to admission when the patient had a biliary tube check , which showed things to be patent despite his rising bilirubin .
He presented now for evaluation of failed biliary drainage .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , he had a normal temperature and blood pressure .
His lungs were clear .
His head and neck showed marked scleral icterus and a cardiac examination showed a systolic ejection murmur .
The abdomen was soft and had well healed right upper quadrant scar .
The extremities were unremarkable .
Rectal examination was negative and his neurological examination was intact .
His hematocrit was 25.8% , with a normal white blood cell count .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics and studied with an abdominal computerized tomography scan .
The computerized tomography scan showed dilated left and right hepatic ducts and was consistent with some form of blockage of the drainage arrangement .
What then ensued was multiple attempts to insure adequate biliary decompression by use of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram and placement of biliary catheters and stents .
The procedures took place on several days throughout the hospital stay with the sentinel pro cedure taking place on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , and this was placement of the 10 mm diameter metal wallstents .
Subsequent to that , he was found to have a subhepatic fluid collection , which was suspicious for a bile leak and therefore a drain was placed percutaneously into this collection .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/95 and <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , very mild revisions were made of these and the feeling was that solution had been reached with good drainage .
His bilirubin by the time of discharge had fallen from a peak of 28 down to a discharge value of 8 .
He was feeling much better , taking good diet and denying pain or fever .
During the course of the hospitalization , he was found to have diarrhea and stool was sent and found to be positive for Clostridium difficile toxin and this initiated treatment with Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for two weeks .
He was covered prophylactically for the indwelling stents with ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , it was deemed he was ready for discharge and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Blinjesc</PHI> discharged him to the care of his primary physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ma</PHI> , in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Taette</PHI> .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ma</PHI> will be working with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Besti Kotebreun</PHI> of <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> to manage the currently indwelling stents .
The patient will continue his course of Flagyl until that is finished and he will stay on the po ofloxacin until the external draining stents are removed .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE :
are Glyburide 5-15 mg po q a.m. and 0-10 mg po q p.m. , depending on amount of oral intake ; Celesone 1 1/2 tablets po q day , Tagamet 400 mg PO b.i.d. , ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d. , CZI sliding scale which will not be continued on discharge , and Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for a total of fourteen days .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1. Primary central nervous system lymphoma .
2. Pancytopenia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old right hand dominant white female with a history of primary central nervous system lymphoma , diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1994 , status post twelve cycles of high dose methotrexate , status post two cycles of high dose ARA-C chemotherapy , who was admitted with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and decreasing platelet count .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 1994 patient developed 2-3 months of headaches , cognitive changes , dizziness and memory loss .
An MRI showed enhancing white marrow lesions at the bifrontal lobes on the right side , and rightsided basal ganglion in the right cerebral peduncle .
The patient underwent a biopsy which showed a primary CNS lymphoma .
The patient was initially treated with high-dose methotrexate for six cycles .
However , the patient developed left IIIrd nerve palsy and an MRI showed increasing lesion in the left ______________ cerebral peduncle and the left mid brain .
The patient was reinduced with high dose methotrexate , 8 mg / meter sq. with some initial tumor response .
However , when the patient was started on 3.5 gm / meter sq. maintenance dose , the tumor progressed .
At that point , the patient was switched over toe high-dose ARA-C ( 2.5 gm / meter sq ) .
On the high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy , the patient developed bone marrow suppression requiring intermittent Neupogen ( GCSF ) support .
The patient remained stable to the last few days prior to admission when she developed insidious rectal bleeding , probably from her external hemorrhoids , along with decreasing platelet count .
On the day of admission the patient &apos;s platelet count dropped to 28,000 and the patient was admitted for her platelet transfusions and further work up for her rectal bleeding .
The patient complained of chronic constipation and rectal bleeding after each bowel movement .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/25</PHI>/95 :
white blood count 5,000 , hematocrit 38 , platelet count 50,000 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 26</PHI> , white blood count 2.5 , hematocrit 29 , platelet count 32,000 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 27</PHI> , white blood count 1.6 , hematocrit 28.9 , platelet count 28,000 :
66 polys , 8 bands with ANC of 1056 .
Sodium 136 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 103 , bicarb 26 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient developed substernal chest pain without radiation on the night of admission .
An electrocardiogram showed flat ST change in lead III , otherwise unremarkable and the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin without symptomatic improvement .
The patient was given 2 units of packed RBC along with the six units of platelet transfusion .
The patient &apos;s symptoms improved with the above measures and the patient no longer complained of chest pain during the hospitalization .
The patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 76,000 on the following morning ; however , her white blood count dropped to 900 with 58 polys with 8 bands .
Because of significant neutropenia , the patient was put on reverse isolation and started on GCSF injections .
The patient &apos;s white blood count improved with the GCSF and her counts went up to 18.2 on the day of discharge .
The patient &apos;s hemoglobin improved to 10.0 after the transfusion and her rectal bleeding apparently stopped .
A GI consultation was made and they felt that the rectal bleeding is most likely from the hemorrhoids and no further intervention was felt to be necessary .
The patient had a follow up MRI scan which showed no significant change of tumor mass .
However , in lieu of a persistent bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy , it was decided that she should undergo radiation therapy .
The patient was assimilated on the day of discharge and the patient will be started on radiation therapy in a few days .
The patient will have a follow up complete blood count with differential on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI>

SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
Brain MRI , <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/12</PHI>/94 .
Placement of chest tube for bleomycin sclerotherapy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/20</PHI>/94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 68 year old female who presented to the emergency room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/22</PHI> with a chief complaint of increasing dyspnea .
She had a long history of significant and complex medical issues .
She had a long history of smoking and fairly severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
In addition , she had insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a recent myocardial infarction in the <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> of 1994 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20</PHI> she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Secla Berl Spo Hospital</PHI> with a chief complaint of chest discomfort and dyspnea .
She presented with wide complex tachycardia and congestive heart failure .
She eventually ruled in for a myocardial infarction and was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/21</PHI> .
Following her hospitalization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital</PHI> he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Louline Mauikings Medical Center</PHI> , where she had a protracted hospitalization during which she was treated for congestive heart failure , gastrointestinal bleeding , and uncontrolled atrial flutter rates .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her jugular venous pressure was within normal limits .
Arterial pulse contours were diminished bilaterally .
S1 and S2 were markedly diminished .
A soft systolic ejection murmur was audible at the base .
A soft Grade I-II / VI holosystolic murmur was evident at the apex .
Breath sounds were markedly diminished on the right ; crackles were present on the left , approximately 1/3 up .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds present and no pulsatile masses evident .
The lower extremity pulses were diminished .
There was 2+ lower extremity edema evident .
No grossly evident focal neurological findings were noted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Crestwall Hospital</PHI> , where a therapeutic thoracentesis was performed in order to alleviate her dyspnea .
Cytology was positive for moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma .
A chest CT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/24</PHI> demonstrated a right lower lobe mass as well as significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy .
A cardiac ultrasound study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Memorial Day</PHI> demonstrated an aortic stenosis with a calculated valve area of .6 square cm .
Following an episode of mild rightsided weakness associated with slurring of speech on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/06</PHI> , a brain MRI was obtained .
An enhancing focus in the left thalamus was thought to represent a subacute infarct .
In addition an old cerebellar focal infarct was noted , although metastasis could not be completely excluded .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Margmimaui Jesclinke</PHI> was consulted and helped significantly with the day to day management of the patient &apos;s COPD and frequent desaturations in the setting of a large , recurrent right pleural effusion .
During the course of the last 4-5 days the patient &apos;s condition deteriorated substantially .
After extensive consultation with her family and with the patient herself , it was decided that her status should be made DNR .
This was completely consonant with her wishes and her family &apos;s wishes as well .
Over the weekend of <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/30</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/01</PHI> , her condition further deteriorated , and she was started on a morphine drip .
She did not respond to intravenous diuretics or renal dose dopamine .
We insured that she was comfortable until she expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/02</PHI>/94 .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cean Leach</PHI> is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ville , Virginia</PHI> for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .
He was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l988 .
He was treated at that time with TPA .
A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .
His ejection fraction was in the mid-50&apos;s.
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
He did well until he developed recurrent angina in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .
He again did well until approximately late l992 .
Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with recurrent chest pain .
He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .
He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40&apos;s and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l994 at 31% .
He was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with a typical episode of this discomfort in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
He was transferred at that time to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
That was his first <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> admission .
Because of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .
His angiograms from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .
He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 13</PHI> , 1994 .
There he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .
Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
Following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .
He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .
However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .
It was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .
He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .
Following that admission in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .
Starting in the <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
He had multiple admissions to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .
He had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .
Because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-9</PHI>-94 .
There is no history of drug abuse or smoking .
Of note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
There is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .
Of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .
His medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He looked generally well .
His blood pressure l60/90 .
His heart rate was 88 .
His jugular venous pressure was normal .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
His femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .
He had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
Potassium of 3.2 .
Normal chloride and CO2 .
His BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .
Glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .
His fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .
His liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .
His hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
the primary concern upon Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .
To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-10</PHI>-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .
The right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .
The left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .
Coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
That is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .
Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .
Impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .
He was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lato Tikfreierm</PHI> of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
After an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .
This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s regiment .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
Repeat in vitro testing of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .
While in the hospital , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .
These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .
There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .
Because of the ongoing nature of his pain .
Multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .
He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .
He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .
Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Protein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .
Factor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .
Thrombin time and repalase time were normal .
It was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .
His anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .
His APC resistance was normal .
He was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
His compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .
Because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .
That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .
On the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .
That was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
He was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .
This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .
There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .
Once again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .
The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .
After extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .
Therefore , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 27</PHI> , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aalv Sctroi</PHI> .
He tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .
He had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 27</PHI> , 1995 .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-20</PHI>-91 at which time a total knee repair was done to both the right and left knees .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to his room on postoperative day one .
The patient did , on , postoperative day one have a bout of grossly heme positive emesis .
He stated at this point that he did have a history of peptic ulcer disease and he did have a slow and continuous drop in his hematocrit until approximately postoperative day three .
The patient also had episodes of significant temperature spikes sometimes to 102.6 .
The patient was cultured multiple times , blood cultures , urine cultures and sputum cultures , all which were negative ( as well as chest x-ray ) .
The temperature spikes did continue but have reached to a degree no higher than 100 degrees Farenheit and occurred a significantly decreased number of times .
In terms of knee function , the patient has progressed very well and is ambulating approximately 12 feet on his own at this point .
In terms of followup care , I would suggest that the patient have a gastroenterologist consult upon completion of Rehab and for further workup of his grossly heme positive emesis , with possible guaiac positive stool searching for a source of a bleed .
The patient will be discharged on the following medications :
Labetalol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Enalapril 5 mg p.o. q.d. ; Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. q.d. ; Ferrous Gluconate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Carafate one gram p.o. q.i.d. ; Quinamm one p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. ; Percocet one to two p.o. q. 4 hours p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">02/28</PHI>/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">2/17</PHI>/94 :
resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm .
The patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/18</PHI>/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Eifro Medical Center</PHI> which was evaluated with a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan .
At that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riode Zetllille</PHI> for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .
The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/31</PHI>/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .
The patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress .
Her head and neck examination is within normal limits .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
She has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass .
Extremities :
are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .
She has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .
Neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .
EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .
Her chest X-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .
There were no intraoperative complications .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient &apos;s procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .
The patient remained intubated postoperatively .
She had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .
On postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .
Epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .
The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .
Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .
The patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
She was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .
This was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .
Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .
Laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels .
Neurological consultation was obtained .
It was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .
The epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .
MRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .
The patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .
She was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .
Continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .
Her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .
Social Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .
The patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .
She was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .
Additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center</PHI> .
It is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .
Is satisfactory .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
(1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection .
During this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Lopressor 25 mg PO b.i.d. , Dulcolax tablets 2 PO q.a.m. , Dulcolax suppository 1 PO q.o.d. , digoxin .125 mg PO q. day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. , Tylenol 650 mg PO / PR q. 4 hours p.r.n. elevated temperature , Benadryl 25-50 PO q.h.s. and Percocet 1-2 tablets PO q. 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riode Zetllille</PHI> and she is to maintain rehabilitation care at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Laelk Memorial Hospital</PHI> .

7. Weight loss , presumably secondary to Cryptococcosis , and AIDS .
Very cachectic , malnourished young man , with extensive oral and facial Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma .
Temperature was 98.8 , blood pressure was 114/70 , heart rate was 72 , respirations were 18 .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat :
Fundi were normal , eomi , pupils equal , round , reactive to light .
Prominent hard right upper cervical lymph node .
Chest was clear .
Cor :
No murmur .
Abdomen was soft and nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly , guaiac positive ( oral bleeding from Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma ) .
GU was normal .
No edema .
Neurologic :
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium was 130 , potassium was 2.0 , phosphorus was 1.8 , magnesium was 1.0 , SGOT was 41 , hematocrit was 34.6 , white blood count was 3.4 , platelet count was 134,000 , chest X-ray was clear .
Head CAT-scan :
No progression of toxoplasmosis , multiple abnormalities consistent with PML .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Malnutrition / cachexia/diarrhea / Cryptosporidiosis .
The patient was treated with PPN and elemental diet , for correction of metabolic disturbances , improved fluid balance , and nutritional support .
Paromomycin was continued until his supply was used up , and charithromycin was continued .
AZT was initiated .
Stool was negative for Cryptosporidium .
His diarrhea diminished .
He developed urinary retention and abdominal pain , which resolved with discontinuation of Lomotil .
However , KUB showed persistent change , consistent with ileus or early partial small bowel obstruction .
As he improved symptomatically and was able to take po without discomfort , it was decided to follow him clinically .
On this admission and on previous outpatient laboratory data , potassium and phosphorus tended to be very low so Neutra-Phos K was continued at discharge .
Lomotil was held at discharge because of question of ileus , but may be reinstituted at a very low dose , for example , 1-2 per day .
Coincident with peripheral parenteral nutrition , the patient developed severe facial swelling , as well as an extreme increase in Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma lesions , with almost total engulfing of his teeth .
He was treated with Vincristine , followed several days later by Bleomycin , with return of his condition to somewhat better than baseline on admission .
It was planned to give him one more dose of Vincristine prior to discharge .
3. Pancytopenia :
There was a decrease in CBC , which was ascribed to AZT , which was discontinued .
4. Chronic VZV :
Biopsy of right lower extremity lesion showed VZV .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 81 year old woman with a history of hypertension , history of recurrent VPBs , admitted for investigation following a syncopal episode two weeks prior to admission .
The patient experienced a brief episode of loss of consciousness while driving her car two weeks prior to admission , at which time she collided with the car in front of her and rapidly regained consciousness .
There was no aura , no witnessed seizure activity and no post ictal symptoms .
The patient has a history of ventricular premature beats for which she was treated with Flecainide .
After the syncopal episode the patient was evaluated at a local hospital with head and abdominal CT , EEG , and EKG , all of which were normal .
Her Flecainide was discontinued and she was referred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CTMC</PHI> for further evaluation .
The patient has history of VPBs as noted above , treated with Flecainide with good symptomatic response .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Left mastectomy in 1982 for breast carcinoma .
DJD , hypertension , status post cholecystectomy , status post cataract surgery , status post herniorrhaphy .
ALLERGIES :
None known .
Vaseretic 10 mg p.o.q.d. , Calan SR 240 mg p.o.q.d. , Motrin 600 mg p.o. prn , Cytotec prn with Motrin .
The patient lives alone .
Her husband is in a nursing home .
She is a nonsmoker , nondrinker .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pleasant elderly lady in no apparent distress .
Blood pressure 140/70 , heart rate 84 , with occasional premature beats , respirations 16 , afebrile .
Showed bruises over both her knees .
HEENT :
Within normal limits .
Neck :
Supple without lympadenopathy .
No JVD .
Lungs :
Clear .
COR :
Showed no JVD .
Normal S1 and S2 without murmurs .
There was a soft right carotid and right femoral bruit .
Digital pulses were absent bilaterally .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , without masses .
Bowel sounds present .
CNS :
Alert and oriented .
Cranial nerves intact .
Sensory motor examination was grossly intact .
Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout .
Extremities :

LFTs were normal .
Cholesterol 252 .
Chest x-ray normal .
EKG was within normal limits .
UA was normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a history of syncope for cardiac evaluation .
It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient &apos;s episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress .
Following this , upon rapid atrial pacing at a rate of 120 , there was revealed a bifascicular left block , which combined with the right bundle branch block caused a complete heart block .
It was felt that given this rate-related block on the left , combined with the possibility of physiologic malfunction on the right , complete heart block as the source of the patient &apos;s syncopal episode was quite possible and plans were made to insert a VVI pacer .
The pacer was inserted on the fifth hospital day without event , and the patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day .
DISPOSITION :
Calan SR 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Vaseretic 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ibuprofen and Cytotec prn joint pain .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a <PHI TYPE="AGE">111y</PHI> year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/01</PHI> complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/93 , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and admitted there from <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/25</PHI> - <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/03</PHI> .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The stones were then removed .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .
Approximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of 15 lb , and nausea and vomiting .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
She was admitted for workup of her symptoms .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above ; appendectomy in 1916 , hysterectomy in 1941 , mastoid surgery in 1970 , shingles of right arm in 1994 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :

Vital signs :
temperature 98.4 , blood pressure 116/60 , pulse 76 , respirations 18 .
HEENT :
sclerae anicteric , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular movements intact , oropharynx mildly dry .
The neck was supple with shotty lymphadenopathy , 2+ carotids without bruits .
Cardiac :
regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Chest :
a few bibasilar crackles ; otherwise clear to auscultation .
Abdomen :
distended , bowel sounds present , tympanitic to percussion anteriorly , dull to percussion laterally .
No guarding or rebound .
Extremities :
no edema .
Breasts :
no masses , lesions or nipple discharge .
No axillary lymphadenopathy .
Neurological :
alert and oriented x 3 .
Cranial nerves II-XII intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count 13.8 , hematocrit 33 , platelet count 353,000 .
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 94 , bicarbonate 31 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 218 , alkaline phosphatase 634 , LDH 212 , SGOT 30 , bilirubin 0.8 direct , total bilirubin 1.2 .
PT 11.8 , PTT 23.9 .
KUB :
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/05</PHI> an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
