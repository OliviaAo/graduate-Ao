significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis . 
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of 03/13/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum examined found to a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .

The patient lined with a Swan Ganz catheter arterial line transferred to the intensive care unit . 
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function a very limited exam . 
the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors antibiotics not reverse his septic course . 
However prior to this noted the patient &apos ;s scrotum necrotic . 
The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .

given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room 2 mgs of intravenous <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">A</PHI>tivan little to stop his rhythmic blinking showed from time to time on examination . 
His hypertension his high blood pressure controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine early then switched to an oral regimen for better control removed from the Intensive Care Unit . 
not felt likely to be due to <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Pa</PHI>rkinson &apos ;s disease , no significant response to Eldopa in the past the patient no evidence of tremor , quite rigid bradykinetic .

In addition , he gadolinium scan not show <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">en</PHI>hancement at the area of his hemorrhage , tumor felt to unlikely . 
this issue need to re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma less prominent to see possibly an underlying tumor arterial venous malformation currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .

was at the highest percentage his percentage to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs felt a very small &quot ; leaflet &quot 
chest pain free throughout his admission . 
given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy aspiration precautions the patient not any pulmonary symptoms during his admission . 
HEMATOLOGY his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room . 
His anticoagulation status to monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolus atrial fibrillation , not placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed . 
drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time placed on heparin intravenous to carry that period , his discharge INR was around 2 was off of heparin that time .

<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">A</PHI> subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution . 
His ejection fraction was in the mid-50&apos ;s. 
Because of angina following that catheterization , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery . 
well recurrent angina in March of l991 at which time repeat catheterization restenosis of his left anterior descending a second PTCA with good results . 
Since that time , multiple admissions to George&apos ;sdgot Medical Center with recurrent chest pain . 
a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40&apos ;s radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">A</PHI>ugust of l994 at 31% . 
admitted to George&apos ;sdgot Medical Center with a typical episode of this discomfort in October of l994 . 
transferred at that time to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> . 
his first <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> admission . 
Because of Mr. 
;s history that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer failed to fixed epicardial coronary disease , provocative testing to evaluate not coronary artery spasm impaired coronary flow reserve . 
taken to the Catheter Laboratory on October 13 , 
a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures . 
Repeat coronary angiography failed to any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery his left coronary system . 
typical anginal discomfort easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin . 
felt the time this study most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve microvascular angina . 
Starting in the October of l994 , started recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort . 
a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction . 
His medications used or in combination include beta blockers coumadin , aspirin , seratonin antagonists . 
no history of drug abuse smoking . 
Of note , his brother a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos ;s . 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION looked generally well . 
His heart rate

His hematocrit approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential normal platelet count . 
HOSPITAL COURSE the primary concern upon Mr.

The left ventricular pressure 
Coronary angiography revealed a picture essentially unchanged from October of l994 . 
Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% . 
Impression at the time of his catheterization the precise etiology of his chest pain 
seen in consultation by Dr. 
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lato Tikfreierm</PHI> of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition primary secondary platelet abnormality his recurrent coronary events . 
his platelets not affected by aspirin showed spontaneous hyperaggragability . 
utilized in making changes in Mr.

his aspirin discontinued put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d. 
Repeat in vitro testing of Mr. 
;s platelets suggested refractory to aspirin , reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously felt to possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect . 
While in the hospital , Mr. 
continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain . 
generally spontaneous in nature lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration . 
improved not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief . 
Multiple changes additions made to his drug regimen . 
tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine diltiazem verapamil . 
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">A</PHI>mlodipine bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome . 
The rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed nearly normal levels of clotting factors , his antithrombin 3 of level lll with a reference range of 80-120 . 
Protein S l14 with a reference range of 70-140 . 
Plasminogen slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal l30 . 
Factor 8 likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 . 
Thrombin time repalase time normal . 
felt these results non-specific represent an acute phase reactants . 
His anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM were within normal range . 
His <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">A</PHI>PC resistance normal . 
Rheumatology felt no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease no further rheumatologic work-up 
multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , felt well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen the recurrent episodes of pain 
His compliment levels normal no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies measured to see some chronic inflammatory process . 
To evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade performed using a local anesthetic stellate ganglion injection . 
then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory repeat exercise testing 
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">A</PHI>fter extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service thoracic surgery , felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome . 
on October 27 , the patient left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. 

that procedure well no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .
