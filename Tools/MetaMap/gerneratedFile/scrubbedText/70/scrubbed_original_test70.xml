a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute . 
A large right ventricular marginal branch fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion . 
The left anterior descending occluded the left circumflex a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , 90% stenosis distally in other branches . 
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
