HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. 
a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in March , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction . 
moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared . 
measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning . 
Over these past 3 years , remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , Atenolol . 
returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , weight gain . 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The carotids were of low volume , sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur . 
dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left . 
The right ventricle , left ventricle impulses diffuse . 
The left atrium dilated to 52 mm . 
evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients not estimated . 
LABORATORY DATA The patient admitted to the Medical Service , placed at bed rest , given intravenous Furosemide . 
At the time of this study , the right atrial pressure 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 10 . 
The aortic valve calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis . 
The posterior descending artery an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft . 
The saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal posterior descending artery patent with good runoff . 
the cardiac catheterization consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction . 
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , complicate to an enormous degree undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement . 
very unlikely Mr.

Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , alpha hemolytic Streptococcus . 
Further evaluation at Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center , the patient mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation initially managed 
Cardiac echo showed moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , good ventricular function .

no evidence of GI pelvic disease account for the bacterial source . 
In addition , evaluated by the Sileyer Medical Center no evidence of active dental infection . 
a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed evidence of stroke . 
no source for sepsis found . 
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , elevated filling pressures , ;s opinion the patient not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics . 
taken to the operating room 
During her cardiac procedure , sustained dissection of the ascending aorta . 
Her valve any material that appeared infected 
Her valve replaced with a St. 
Jude Medical mitral prosthesis possible to place the valve securely . 
weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure . 
bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis . 
With clotting factor replacement , bleeding abated no longer a problem . 
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate apparent her prognosis extremely poor .

The plan to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma . 
The patient &apos ;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine never biopsied the MRI appearance not to infectious most consistent with plasmacytoma receiving the radiation therapy . 
initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front then 6 mg q6h.

In the days following admission , clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba . 
Most likely source of fevers judged to progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy . 
Patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .
