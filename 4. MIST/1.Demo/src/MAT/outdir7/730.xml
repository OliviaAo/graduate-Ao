HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 46 year old black man from <LOCATION>Rio</LOCATION> with AIDS .
The patient was noted to be VDRL positive in 1985 and was treated with Penicillin .
A fluorescein treponemal antibody test in 1987 was slightly positive at a titer of 1:4 .
In 1989 , the patient was noted to develop bloody diarrhea .
An upper GI series with flexible sigmoidoscopy and barium enema were negative , and the patient was subsequently treated with iron .
In <DATE>January 1989</DATE> , the patient developed an upper respiratory tract infection with chest x-ray revealing increased interstitial markings and pleural effusions .
An ESR was noted to be 130 , and the patient was treated with Erythromycin .
In <DATE>February 1989</DATE> , the patient was subsequently diagnosed as HIV positive .
A gallium scan was positive at the right hilum .
A chest CT revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy .
The patient was subsequently admitted to the <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> with a temperature of 103.2 .
Supraclavicular lymph node biopsy revealed acid fast bacilli , and the patient was subsequently treated with 18 months of INH , Rifampin , and Ethambutol .
The patient was discharged on AZT and Dapsone , and a CD4 count at that time was 40 .
Due to a misunderstanding , the patient discontinued his Dapsone after 18 months .
In <DATE>October 1990</DATE> , the patient was admitted again to the <HOSPITAL>Retelk County Medical Center</HOSPITAL> with diarrhea and acute renal failure secondary to hypovolemia .
Again , flexible sigmoidoscopy and stool cultures were negative .
In <DATE>November of 1990</DATE> , however , the patient was diagnosed with gastric cryptosporidiosis based upon a gastric biopsy .
The patient was otherwise doing well on AZT until <DATE>November 30 , 1991</DATE> , at which time the patient developed a temperature of 103 accompanied by frontal headache , nonproductive cough , and rhinorrhea .
The patient complained of intermittent shortness of breath , but no rigors , chest pain , or GI symptoms .
These symptoms persisted with an increasing cough until the <DATE>5th of December</DATE> at which time he presented to the <HOSPITAL>Lorough Medical Center</HOSPITAL> &apos;s Emergency Room with a temperature of 103.1 , and a worsened cough without sputum production .
At that time , his white count was noted to be 4.5 with a differential of 70 polys , 6 bands , 18 lymphs , and 6 monocytes .
An LDH was 453 .
Head CT and LP were negative .
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial infiltrates .
An ABG on two liters of oxygen per minute via nasal prong was 7.40 , 87 , 35 , and 97% .
The patient was started on Bactrim with steroids held for fear of possible reactivation of TB .
On the <DATE>6th of December</DATE> , the patient had a temperature of 104 with oxygen saturations running 93% on two liters of oxygen via nasal prong .
On the <DATE>7th of December</DATE> , the patient began a steady deterioration in his respiratory status requiring increasing oxygen requirements .
The sputum was positive for pneumocysts , and the patient was started on Prednisone 40 mg b.i.d.
His chest x-ray revealed increased infiltrates without pneumothorax .
The following day , the patient &apos;s ABG was noted to be a pH of 7.32 , p02 50 , pCO2 43 , 82% on 100% high flow face masks .
The patient was subsequently intubated and given 40 mg of Lasix IV and transferred to the MICU for further management .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
MICU COURSE-The patient was continued on Bactrim at 15 mg / kg per day in divided doses for his PCP pneumonia .
The patient was switched from p.o. Prednisone to IV Solu-Medrol at equivalent therapeutic doses .
The patient &apos;s respiratory wheezes were treated symptomatically with bronchodilators .
The patient &apos;s anemia was treated with folate , iron , and vitamin B-12 .
The patient was noted to be agitated at times with acute oxygen desaturations at these times .
The patient was started on a Morphine drip for control .
The patient &apos;s peak inspiratory pressures were noted to be elevated , consistent with an ARDS picture .
The patient was therefore started on pressure controlled ventilation resulting in a decrease in his PIP from 60 to 45 .
On <DATE>12/10/91</DATE> , the patient was noted to have an acutely diminished white count at 2.0 with a hematocrit of 32.0 .
The patient was also noted to have decreased urine output with an acute increase in his creatinine from 1.5 to 2.2 .
Despite improvement in his chest x-ray noted on that day which was believed to be attributable to the steroids , the patient was switched to IV Pentamidine given the possibility of myelosuppression by Bactrim .
Consultation with Dr. <DOCTOR>Test</DOCTOR> led to a plan to begin aerosolized Pentamidine 100 mg nebilized q.d. for three days while therapeutic levels of Pentamidine could be build up in the lungs via IV .
However , the patient was noted to become increasingly hypotensive with decreased urine output .
The patient became anuric with increasing metabolic acidosis .
The patient was started on Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 hours for presumed sepsis .
Despite this measure , the patient became increasingly hypotensive requiring the addition of Dopamine and Levophed drips .
The patient &apos;s condition deteriorated overnight with increasing metabolic acidosis despite bicarbonate .
The patient &apos;s oliguria renal failure continued despite fluid boluses and diuretics .
The patient &apos;s electrolytes became increasingly difficult to manage with hyperkalemia , hyperphosphatemia , and hypocalcemia .
On the morning of <DATE>12/11/91</DATE> , the patient &apos;s blood pressure dropped to 60/palpable despite the addition of Neo-Synephrine .
At this time , his arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.07 , and the patient became aystolic .
The patient was subsequently declared dead at 7:58 A.M.
Medications at the time of death :
Pentamidine 100 mg nebulized q.d. times three days , Pentamidine 300 mg IV q.d. , Solu-Medrol 20 mg IV t.i.d. , Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 , Morphine sulfate drip at 5 mg / hour IV , Dopamine drip 18 mcg / kg/min IV drip , Pavulon 2 mg IV q1hour , Levophef 16 mcg / min IV drip , ferrous sulfate 324 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , Folate 1 mg per NG tube q.d. , vitamin B-12 , Colace , vitamin K , senna .
DISPOSITION :
The wife was approached for permission for autopsy which she agreed to .
