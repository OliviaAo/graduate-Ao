Discharge Date :
<DATE>01/20/1991</DATE>
HISTORY :
The patient is a seventy-two-year-old male with a history of diffuse atherosclerotic disease who had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 followed a failed angioplasty .
Coincident with the angioplasty he received a large contrast load leading to the development of renal failure and hemodialysis .
He also has had bilateral carotid endarterectomy and right aorto-femoral bypass .
The patient had done well until about two weeks prior to admission when he started developing several episodes of chest pain with minimal exertion .
He was admitted when he failed medical therapies for a diagnostic catheterization to evaluate his saphenous grafts and his native coronary circulation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission physical exam he had a blood pressure of 152/92 , pulse 80 and regular , respirations 18 .
On cardiac exam he had a slightly diffuse point of maximal impulse , normal S1 , split S2 , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the left sternal border , positive S4 .
The carotids were one plus with bruits bilaterally .
The left femoral is barely perceptible , right femoral two plus with a bruit .
The abdominal aorta was approximately 4 cm .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram on admission was normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis , left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On <DATE>January 17 , 1991</DATE> , the patient had a catheterization that showed an occluded proximal right coronary artery with the PDA filling via left to right collaterals , an occluded left circumflex after the OMB2 , and a very proximal occlusion of the LAD .
With regard to his saphenous grafts , the saphenous vein graft to the LAD was patent , as were the grafts to LADD1 and to the marginal territory .
The patient had recurrent chest pain at rest in the hospital .
Antianginals were increased and including Procardia was increased to 90 q.d.
These changes in his medical regiment seemed to significantly improve his angina .
It was decided that he would be discharged on medical management .
We were very reluctant to recommend further invasive interventions in view of his dissuse atherosclerosis and renal failure , which make him a very high risk candidate for further PTCAs .
During the hospitalization the patient was dialyzed for his renal failure .
On admission his BUN and creatinine were 7.4 and 48 .
He received dialysis without complication .
The patient was anemic .
On presentation he had a hematocrit of 29.5 secondary to renal failure .
He was transfused during the hospitalization .
He was discharged in stable condition on the following medications :
Procardia XL , 90 mg p.o. q.d. ; Lopressor , 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; nitroglycerine 1/150 1 tab s.l. p.r.n. pain ; Nitrol patch , 10 mg q.a.m. ; iron sulfate , 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nephrocaps , 1 tab. p.o. q.d. ; Xanax , 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
He is to have a low cholesterol , low fat renal diet .
Activities as tolerated .
He is to be followed-up by his private doctor .
