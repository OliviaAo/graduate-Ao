<DATE>11/18/96</DATE>
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Right carotid artery occlusion .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
She underwent arch aortography with run off to the great vessels on <DATE>11/15/96</DATE> .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Dalmane 30 mg PO q. day , Doxepin 75 mg PO b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg PO q.day , Cardizem 60 mg PO t.i.d. , Percocet one to two PO q. 4 hours p.r.n. and Coumadin 5 mg every other day alternating with 10 mg every other day .
Her anticoagulation follow up is with the Anticoagulation Clinic .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 51-year-old woman with a complexvascular operative history including , in 1990 , lower extremity bypasses and an aorto-bifem .
In 1992 right carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis .
In 1992 left carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis .
Some time in early 1993 re-do right carotid endarterectomy and in 1995 aorto , in nominate and left common carotid bypass graft with a 14 X 7 bifurcated Dacron graft .
She is now back with recurrent symptoms consisting of left arm and leg weakness with shaking , as well as transient episodes of amaurosis fugax in her right eye .
She is to undergo angiography and then perhaps , if amenable , a surgical procedure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Crohn &apos;s disease .
She has had multiple bowel resections .
Lumbar disc disease .
Angina with a frequency of once or twice a month .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Pravachol 10 mg PO q.p.m. , Lopid 600 mg PO q.p.m. , Dalmane 30 mg PO q.day , Doxepin 75 mg PO b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg PO q.day , Cardizem 60 mg PO t.i.d. , Percocet one to two PO q. 4 hours p.r.n. , Ventolin four per day , Azmacort two puffs q.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg q.o.d. alternating with 10 mg q.o.d.
ALLERGIES :
Gadolinium .
HABITS :
She smoked cigarettes until about two months ago and has a long smoking history .
She doesn &apos;t drink alcohol .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is divorced and lives with a roommate in <LOCATION>Tjay St. , Wa , Missouri 74493</LOCATION> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature 97.8 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 120/70 .
Sclerae anicteric .
Symmetric face .
Neck :
bilateral bruits , very diminished right carotid pulse if any , and a brisk left carotid pulse .
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with median sternotomy scar .
Heart regular rate and rhythm without a murmur .
The abdomen is soft without bruit .
Multiple midline scars .
No organomegaly .
GU :
Normal female .
Rectal guaiac negative .
Multiple external hemorrhoids .
Normal tone .
Nomasses .
Pulses are :
radial-left trace , right 2+ ; brachial-left 1+ , right 2+ ; femoral 2+ bilaterally ; popliteal 2+ bilaterally ; dorsalispedis 2+ bilaterally ; posterior tibial 2+ bilaterally .
ASSESSMENT :
Complicated patient who has continued smoking for her extensive peripheral vascular disease history .
She now has possibly quit cigarettes , but has renewed symptoms of right carotid disease .
She is to undergo an angiogram when her coagulation profile allows .
She has been on Coumadin .
We will check her coags before heparinizing , and she will go to angiography when her prothrombin time comes within an acceptable range .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was seen by Dr. <DOCTOR>Tomedankell Flowayles</DOCTOR> of Cardiology who recommended that , if she were to undergo an operative procedure , that she first have a coronary perfusion scan .
The patient was also seen by Dr. <DOCTOR>Breutz</DOCTOR> of the GI Service who assessed her as not needing colonoscopy or a GI series at this time .
She was also seen by the Stroke Service who noted that a recent magnetic resonance angiogram had reportedly shown a right common carotid artery occlusion .
They also noted that a careful elicitation of her visual symptoms seemed possibly consistent more with migraine than with ischemia .
They recommended that she have a baseline head computerized tomographyscan , agreed with obtaining an angiogram and recommended trying a trial of migraine therapy to see if ocular symptoms resolved .
Meanwhile the patient was heparinized .
Her prothrombin time came down and , on <DATE>11/15/96</DATE> , she underwent angiography .
This showed :
1. a patent aorto innominate left common carotid graft .
2. an occluded right common carotid artery , right internal carotid and reconstitution of a short segment of right external carotid from the left vertebral .
3. a mild stenosis of the right proximal subclavian artery .
4. mild stenosis of the right vertebral origin .
5. apatent left common carotid , left internal carotid , status post left carotid endarterectomy .
6. an occluded left external carotid .
7. a patent left subclavian proximally , occluded left axillary artery with reconstitution ofthe left brachial artery .
8. moderate to severe stenosis of the left vertebral origin .
9. right cerebral hemisphere fills from the left vertebral and the left internal carotid .
Given these angiographic findings , which were not amenable to surgery , the patient was weaned from heparin , restarted on Coumadin , and was discharged today , <DATE>11/18/96</DATE> , with therapeutic protime .
In retrospect , her symptoms may have been surrounding the final thrombosis of her right carotid .
A perfusion scan was not necessary as no surgical procedure was entertained .
An I-head computerized tomography scan done on <DATE>11/16/96</DATE> showed two areas of old infarction without evidence of a recent infarct or bleed .
Both the old infarcts were in the right hemisphere , # 1 in the frontal lobe nad # 2 around the centrum semi ovale .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient was discharged home in good condition .
FOLLOW UP :
She will follow up with her local doctor &apos;s Coumadin clinic .
