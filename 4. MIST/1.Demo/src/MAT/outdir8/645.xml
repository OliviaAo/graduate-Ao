The patient tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively was hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 31 and stable vital signs .
The decision was made to give her two units of packed red blood cells due to a borderline hypotension .
She was seen by both Diabetes and Pulmonary Services who recommended appropriate adjustment of her insulin doses as well as her pulmonary issues ; primarily she was treated with nebulizers and inhalers as well as chest physical therapy and had no pulmonary complications .
She was slow to mobilize with physical therapy due to weakness and proprioceptive difficulties .
