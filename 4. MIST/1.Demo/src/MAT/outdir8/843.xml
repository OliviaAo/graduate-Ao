HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
<PATIENT>Nakoloyd Knutzxelljesc</PATIENT> is a fifty-one year old female who presented with metastatic lung cancer in <DATE>July 1994</DATE> .
A work up at that time included a chest X-ray which showed a right hilar mass .
A chest computerized tomography scan showed a right hilar mass , extensive mediastinal adenopathy .
A bone scan showed lesions at T12 and T9 .
Abdominal CT scan showed normal adrenal .
Magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine revealed an erosive lesion at T12 and no cord compression .
A biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma .
The patient was entered onto the ICE-T protocol and received three cycles of ICE-T.
After cycle two she had an MRI of the T-spine which showed some improvement in the disease .
After cycle three , she developed severe headache .
An MRI of the central nervous system was done and was unremarkable .
The pain her head became so severe she was admitted to <HOSPITAL>E Health</HOSPITAL> after cycle three with fever , neutropenia , headache , and a cellulitis on the left forearm possibly from an intravenous site .
She was discharged from the hospital on <DATE>11-04-94</DATE> with all of her problems under reasonable control except for her severe headache .
She called me on <DATE>November 5</DATE> , which was one day later , with the headache becoming much worse and becoming disabling .
She , therefore , was admitted for evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination revealed a middle aged woman with alopecia , and in no acute distress .
The blood pressure was 100/60 , pulse of 70 , respirations of 20 , temperature was 98.6 .
Skin with alopecia , as noted .
HEENT examination was unremarkable .
The neck was supple .
The lungs were clear .
Heart revealed regular rate and rhythm , without murmurs .
Breast exam with status post bilateral implants .
Belly was soft and nontender .
Extremities without edema .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
The white blood count was 9.8 , hematocrit was 29.1 , platelet count was 233,000 .
She had 58% polys , 21% bands , 7% lymphs , 7% monos .
The prothrombin time was 10.6 .
The BUN and creatinine was 13/0.7 , glucose 115 , amylase less than 30 , calcium 9.2 , phosphorus 4.9 , magnesium 1.7 , alkaline phosphatase 302 , SGOT 42 , LDH 360 , CPK 348 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Because of the severe headache , she was seen in consultation by Dr. <DOCTOR>Rashanemar Block</DOCTOR> and Dr. <DOCTOR>Riord R. Hall</DOCTOR> .
Dr. <DOCTOR>Rashanemar Block</DOCTOR> did a lumbar puncture which revealed an opening pressure of 27 , and her cytologies came back positive for adenocarcinoma .
She was seen in consultation by the Pain Service who placed her on a posterior communicating artery pump which helped her dramatically .
In addition , we obtained both cranial and neck MR which showed no evidence of any enhancement or epidural abscess .
When it was found that she had carcinomatous meningitis , she began interthecal methotrexate , given to her every three to four days by Dr. <DOCTOR>Hall</DOCTOR> .
This was well tolerated .
Her cerebrospinal fluid pressure remained greater than 35 cm of water for the first several days and because of this we decided to place an Ommaya reservoir .
The patient was seen in consultation by Radiation Therapy who did not feel that radiation at this point would offer any advantages .
She had a CSF flow study which showed normal flow CSF throughout her brain .
She had multiple episodes of seizures during the hospitalization and required therapy with Tegretol .
She was given some Mexiletine and Trazodone and did not tolerate that well .
Once she was on good anti-seizure medicine , she calmed down very nicely in terms of not having any additional seizures .
For the last several days of her hospitalization , we switched her over to a Duragesic patch and she actually took 300 micrograms per hour of Duragesic and that seemed to make a big difference in terms of her pain control .
Her headache came under very nice control with aggressive Duragesic patch .
Access became a major problem and we had Dr. <DOCTOR>Anruchelle Chaffchird</DOCTOR> from Surgical Oncology place a double Port-a-cath without difficulty .
The plan with <PATIENT>Knutzxelljesc</PATIENT> will be to follow her very carefully .
She will be coming back to see us next Tuesday for infusion of her methotrexate .
