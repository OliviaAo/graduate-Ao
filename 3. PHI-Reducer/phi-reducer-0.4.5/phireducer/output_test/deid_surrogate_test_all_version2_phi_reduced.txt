PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS Unstable angina . ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS Hypertension . PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE Right and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on **PHIDate** . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS This 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in **PHI** **PHI** for chronic angina . She had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction . There was a 90 % right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty . There were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully . However , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not **PHI** crossed with the balloon . She did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension . In the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil . During the **PHI** and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas **PHI** Hospital on **PHIDate** with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210 108 . Cardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION Medications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 **PHI** **PHI** . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION On physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with **PHI** posterior tibial pulses felt . LABORATORY DATA The electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block . The electrolytes were normal . The admission hematocrit was 34 . HOSPITAL COURSE On **PHIDate** , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20 % with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive . The new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis . But the low circumflex marginal could not **PHI** entered with a wire . The first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted . The patient did well **PHI** procedure . **PHI** developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .

The initial presentation was the orifice of the right upper lobe with mediastinoscopy positive for subcarinal lymph node . **PHI** received 6,000 rads to his mediastinum with external beam . Subsequently , **PHI** returned to Goo where **PHI** received another 3,000 rads via **PHI** endobronchial catheter , apparently due to recurrence . Over the pat three to four weeks , **PHI** started having increased dyspnea and noted wheezing . A bronchoscopy showed protrusion of the tumor into the right main stem bronchus with a positive needle biopsy , washings and brushings for squamous cell carcinoma . A computerized tomography scan showed a **PHI** subcarinal mass . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY His past medical history was significant for malignant bladder tumor in 1991 . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION On physical examination , Mr. **PHI** had very marked inspiratory and expiratory stridor . There were **PHI** nodes present . The breath sounds were somewhat decreased through **PHI** lung **PHI** . His cardiac examination did not show any murmur , gallop , or cardiomegaly . There was **PHI** hepatosplenomegaly , and **PHI** peripheral edema . HOSPITAL COURSE A bronchoscopy with the intention of coring out tumor was carried out by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** , but all the tumor was extrinsic to the airway and **PHI** was unable to relieve the obstruction . The tumor now involves the trachea as well as the right main bronchus . His major complaint was of persistent severe coughing and secretions . Ultimately , only codeine at 30 mg q6h controlled him and this was very affective . Inhalers provide only mild relief . **PHI** is aware of his prognosis . The patient was also seen by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** of the Oncology **PHI** who did not feel that chemotherapy had anything of promise to offer .

Unsigned DIS Report Status Unsigned ADMISSION DATE **PHIDate** DISCHARGE DATE **PHIDate** DIAGNOSES Aortic stenosis . ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS Stenosis of porcine aortic valve with fibrous pannus formation , coronary disease , status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting , manic depressive disorder , left ventricular dysfunction , question of basilar artery migraine . PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE **PHIDate** , right and left heart catheterization ( transeptal ) with coronary graft and left ventriculogram . **PHIDate** , open heart aortic valve replacement and bypass of right coronary artery . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. **PHI** is a 65 year old male who , in 1986 , had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure at **PHI** **PHI** Health in **PHI** , Kansas . This involved construction of **PHI** internal mammary graft from the left internal mammary artery to the left circumflex , a right internal mammary was anastomosed to the anterior descending and diagonal branch , and a saphenous vein was constructed to the right coronary artery . **PHI** did well , but appeared here in 1991 with high grade aortic stenosis , and **PHI** ejection fraction of only 23 %. **PHI** underwent aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve by Dr. G **PHI** . Following this , **PHI** was followed closely by Dr. **PHI** in **PHI** . Over the last several months , **PHI** **PHI** had a recurrence of his congestive heart failure and **PHI** echocardiogram performed by Dr. **PHI** suggested the possibility of the development of aortic stenosis . **PHI** also was having some chest tightness , as well as increasing shortness of breath . The patient was referred here for further evaluation . Mr. **PHI** suffers from a bipolar mood disorder , together with hypercholesterolemia and vertebral basilar insufficiency . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION On physical examination , the patient was a well developed , stocky gentleman . The blood pressure was 115 80 , pulse 80 , respirations of 20 , venous pressure elevated at 3 cm above the clavicle at 90 degrees . There were very small , barely palpable carotid pulses . There was dullness at the right base , with a high diaphragm and possibly some fluid . The cardiac examination showed a left ventricular tap at the fifth intercostal space left of the midclavicular line . There was a grade II VI systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area , **PHI** third sound , and paradoxical splitting of the second sound . The liver was not palpable . There were diminished pulses in the legs . LABORATORY DATA The hemoglobin was 14.4 grams percent , **PHI** blood count 6,900 , platelet count 125,000 , sodium 137 mEq . per liter , potassium of 4.7 , **PHI** and creatinine of 23 and 1.3 mg percent . The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non specific ST T wave changes . The chest film showed massive cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous engorgement . HOSPITAL COURSE I indicated to Dr. **PHI** that I had never seen a situation in which **PHI** adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical **PHI** suggested aortic stenosis . Accordingly , on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , **PHI** underwent a cardiac catheterization . The study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels . The right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it . Using transeptal catheterization , **PHI** proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was **PHI** doubt about his aortic stenosis . The left ventricular contraction showed **PHI** ejection fraction of around 25 %. **PHI** attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , Dr. G **PHI** performed open heart surgery . At the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement . There was **PHI** calcification of the valve , and **PHI** clear evidence of infection . I have in fact never seen anything quite like this on **PHI** aortic porcine valve . The valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction . The surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly . Mr. **PHI** was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with **PHI** aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes . Postoperatively , the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day . **PHI** had a good deal of pulmonary congestion . **PHI** seemed to **PHI** doing well until the morning of **PHIDate** when **PHI** suddenly became pulseless . There was **PHI** evidence of ventricular fibrillation . Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately undertaken , but was not successful . The patient had his chest opened for any evidence of tamponade and there was **PHI** evidence of bleeding . The heart appeared to **PHI** flaccid . We really have **PHI** good explanation of what this was all about . **PHI** was being treated for a possible pneumonia . **PHI** did have a good deal of pulmonary congestion , but this occurred suddenly and unexpectedly . Cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts were carried out for virtually one hour , but were unsuccessful . The patient was pronounced dead on the morning of **PHIDate** .

CAUSATIVE FACTORS Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. **PHI** at **PHI** **PHI** Health in 1986 . In 1991 **PHI** presented with congestive heart failure and **PHI** underwent porcine aortic valve replacement . In the seven to eight months preceding admission , **PHI** developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion . The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early **PHI** , **PHI** . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin **PHI** mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg.( interval unspecified ), Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , **PHI** 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Remarkable for **PHI** oriented , alert male in **PHI** acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a **PHIDate** systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis . His pulse exam was intact . Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index . There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip . A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present . Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin . **PHI** procedure **PHI** was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection . **PHI** remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety **PHI** would not swallow the probe . Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to **PHI** 18 % with global hypokinesis . The next several **PHI** were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan . The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re do aortic valve replacement and possible re do coronary artery bypass grafting . In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. **PHI** was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications . On **PHI** **PHI** the patient underwent surgery , including a re do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re do coronary artery bypass grafting **PHI** one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno venous jump graft . The total bypass time 2 hours 25 minutes . Total crossclamp time 1 hour and 48 minutes . The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride . The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to **PHI** relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement . Chest x ray demonstrating pulmonary edema . Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly . In addition , **PHI** remained agitated . This was attributed to mild hypoxia and or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and **PHI** was treated with Haldol appropriately . On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix Mannitol infusion . His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc . **PHI** hour . Despite this , his chest x ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated . **PHI** required anti hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting . **PHI** received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure . Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication . With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved . Throughout this **PHI** remained hemodynamically stable . Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to **PHI** ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine . His chest x ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum . Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin . Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient & apos ; s increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to **PHI** R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval . Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued . In addition , the patient was **PHI** magnesium to bring his level above 2 . On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal . On 60 % FIO2 his pO2 was 63 . It was increased to 65 % with pO2 of 81 . At approximately 7 50 a.m., house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70 40 with falling oxygen saturations . The patient was immediately **PHI** 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v . push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated . Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called . The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with **PHI** and **PHI** was bolused with Levophed and **PHI** some volume while compressions continued . The patient & apos ; s prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained . The chest was opened partially and through sub xyphoid area it was determined that there was **PHI** evidence of tamponade . Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion . The patient & apos ; s rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and **PHI** was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of **PHI** , one half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation . Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8 30 a.m .

At the time of transfer , the patient seemed reasonably compensated , nevertheless , abdominal paracentesis was done , which showed unequivocal evidence of backterial peritonitis , for which the patient was intiially treated with Ampicillin , Gentamicin and Flagyl for two **PHI** and then switched to **PHI** 3 grams per day . The patient was initially febrile , but then became afebrile on antibiotic therapy . The patient was evaluated for long term therapy . The patient developed increasing ascites in conjunction with her bacterial peritonitis , and was placed on diuretics with Aldactone and Lasix . Marked abdominal tenderness was noted due to a bacterial peritonitis , which gradually cleared over several **PHI** . Because of the patient & apos ; s history of asystole , she was discussed with Dr. **PHI** as a possible transplant candidate . **PHI** felt that significant coronary artery disease should **PHI** ruled out . For that reason a gaited blood pool scan was done with a 45 % ejection fraction . A Persantine Thallium stress test was done , which was negative for ischemia . Her diabetes mellitus was managed on a sliding scale , and she had one episode of hypoglycemia , secondary to fasting . The patient was officially evaluated for transplantation by Dr. **PHI** , who felt , although there was **PHI** absolute contraindication to transplantation , that her multiple medical problems made her a poor candidate , and that her chronic disability since a previous auto accident made it unlikely that she would ever **PHI** returned to useful function . **PHI** upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on **PHIDate** and revealed portal hypertension gastropathy , and grade 4 varices of the esophagus . Meanwhile , she began to diuresis effectively on oral antibiotics , and intravenous antibiotics were discontinued after ten **PHI** and repeat paracentesis performed with only 320 **PHI** cells , with **PHI** preponderance of polys . The patient was difficult to mobilize , and required the assistance of her family as her diuresis progressed , eventually the diuretic program had to **PHI** reduced because of a drop in her weight , associated with nausea and weakness , with her weight eventually falling down to 123 pounds . At the time of maximum diuresis , she developed lethargy , and cramping of her extremities , and the diuretics had to **PHI** temporarily discontinued , and **PHI** optimum weight was finally decided upon , that was felt to **PHI** between 126 and 128 . This period of time there was a brief increase in her SGOT from the 100 & apos ; s to 230 .

The cardiac exam showed point of maximal impulse was not displaced , regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 , S2 , **PHI** S3 or S4 , a grade II VI systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border without radiation , likely representing a **PHI** murmur . **PHI** peripheral edema was noted . The jugular venous pressure was not assessed secondary to cervical collar being in place . The carotid pulses were brisk bilaterally . The vascular exam showed normal pulses bilaterally without bruits . The abdomen was soft , bowel sounds of normal character , and there was mild percussion tenderness and tenderness to modest palpation in all four quadrants . It was unclear whether this was due to superficial tenderness or abdominal tenderness . **PHI** had marked voluntary guarding without rigidity and **PHI** masses were felt . The genitourinary exam showed normal penis with normal testicles which were nontender . There was **PHI** urethritis , **PHI** **PHI** , normal prostate , nontender . There was tan guaiac positive stool with **PHI** masses . The musculoskeletal exam showed well developed , symmetrical muscular development with **PHI** fasciculations , **PHI** joint erythema , **PHI** effusions . Neuro exam the Mental Status Exam was variable , intermittently responsive , unable to follow commands . **PHI** nods appropriately and was able to confirm known history . The cranial nerves II **PHI** grossly intact , bilaterally symmetric . The motor exam moves all four extremities easily and on command . The sensory exam revealed **PHI** focal deficits to limited exam . Reflexes were trace in the upper extremities and absent in the knees with downgoing toes bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA On admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , **PHI** 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 . The SGOT was 994 , LDH 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 . Lactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4 . The **PHI** blood count was 19.7 with 89 % polys , 7 % bands , 4 % lymphs , with toxic granulations . Hematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 . The MCV is 88 . The prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 . The urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , pH 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0 5 granular casts and 5 10 RBCs and 3 5 WBCs . The CK was 17,890 with 0.6 % MB . The urine sodium was 147 . The serum toxicology was positive for Cocaine on admission to the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital as well as the **PHI** Center . The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged QT at 0.572 . **PHI** I **PHI** CT revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and **PHI** focal hemorrhages . The abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver . Chest x ray revealed early interstitial edema . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication . **PHI** was accepted at the **PHI** Yd **PHI** Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will **PHI** reviewed by problems . 1 Rhabdomyolysis . The patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis . This resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia . The patient & apos ; s creatinine kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages . The aldolase was positive at 142 . This was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities . The patient & apos ; s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion . The patient & apos ; s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine . Nevertheless , the patient & apos ; s renal failure continued to progress . Over the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum . Much of his diffuse pain was felt to **PHI** due to this massive rhabdomyolysis . 2 Renal failure . The creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th . The urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood . Peritoneal dialysis was instituted on **PHIDate** after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs . **PHI** , **PHI** , and Round . Subsequently his creatinine rose for three **PHI** and then stabilized at 10 . **PHI** continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization . 3 Disseminated intravascular coagulation . On admission the patient & apos ; s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 . **PHI** went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage . The patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells . His DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and **PHI** remained fresh frozen plasma dependent . 4 Septic shock . The patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization . **PHI** was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support . Hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output . **PHI** had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines . This will **PHI** discussed below . Further **PHI** had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure . **PHI** echocardiogram on **PHIDate** revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with **PHI** vegetations . His ejection fraction was 55 %. On **PHIDate** the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and **PHI** SVR of 5.8 . 5 Hepatic failure . His SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two . **PHI** had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time . **PHI** was seen in consultation by the GI **PHI** and the Liver Transplantation **PHI** . **PHI** his multiple other medical problems , the **PHI** of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission **PHI** was deemed not to **PHI** a candidate for a liver transplantation . 6 Cocaine intoxication . **PHI** Cocaine was positive 6 12 hours ingestion at the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital . Further , at **PHI** **PHI** Center his serum toxicology screens were positive . This is thought to **PHI** the **PHI** cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure . 7 Pneumonia . The patient developed two **PHI** with two separate organisms . The first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin . **PHI** subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to **PHI** appropriate for his renal failure . **PHI** was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease **PHI** who advised us on antibiotic choices daily . 8 Pancreatitis . The amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 . Although not fully this **PHI** have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements . 9 Catheter tip infections . The patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension . These were treated with Vancomycin . 10 Anemia . The patient & apos ; s hematocrit was 33 % on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization . 11 **PHI** . The patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state . **PHI** CT scan on admission revealed **PHI** evidence of hemorrhage though **PHI** did have sphenoid sinusitis . The lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to **PHI** performed **PHI** the patient & apos ; s persistent coagulopathy . The patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis . Further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy . Despite maximal supports the patient continued to **PHI** hypotensive . Mid way through his hospital course **PHI** developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi organ system failure syndrome . The patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization . Nevertheless , **PHI** developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support . DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS Cocaine intoxication , rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic shock , hepatic failure , pneumonia , pancreatitis , catheter tip infection , anemia , coma . PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE Peritoneal dialysis catheter placement , peritoneal dialysis , arterial catheterization , venous catheterization , continuous mechanical ventilation , and parenteral nutrition . COMPLICATIONS DURING ADMISSION Neck hematoma secondary to pulmonary artery line placement requiring transfusion , catheter tip infection . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE None .

She was transferred to the Sas **PHI** Hospital for further evaluation of some weakness in the setting of multiple medical problems . The patient had o.d . glaucoma surgery , 1400 hours , on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . Soon after surgery , the patient noted her left lower face and hand were weak . She was brought to the emergency room where she was evaluated and determined to have had a cerebrovascular accident . She **PHI** absolutely **PHI** neurologic disease in past .

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION Dyazide one p.o . q.d . Propanolol 5 mg. p.o . t.i.d . Isordil 5 mg. p.o . t.i.d . Glaucoma drops . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION blood pressure 118 75 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 , in **PHI** acute distress . **PHI** and neck exam was unremarkable , except for the right eye being patched over . Lungs were clear . Breasts were unremarkable . Back was nontender . **PHI** exam regular rate and rhythm , jugular venous pressure was normal , **PHI** carotid bruit was noted ; murmur , rub , gallop , click and ectopy were absent . Abdomen was benign . Rectal tone was normal , guaiac negative stool . Extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema or stigmata of subacute bacterial endocarditis . Normal pulses were palpated . Neurologic exam the patient was alert and oriented x 4 . Extensive mental status testing was normal , except for recalling only one out of three objects at five minutes . There was a touch **PHI** anosognosia . Cranial nerve exam visual **PHI** were full o.s . , visual acuity was 20 70 o.s . Pupil o.s . reacted to light . **PHI** with full range of movement , **PHI** nystagmus . VIIth cranial nerve inferior left weak . **PHI** gag was present . Otherwise normal CN & apos ; s . DTRs showed a mild decrease in left biceps and brachioradialis reflexes , otherwise normal tone , symmetrical reflexes , downgoing toes . Motor exam 5+ throughout , except left hand intrinsic muscles were 4+, 3+ in the middle digits . **PHI** atrophy was noted . Sensory exam showed some leftsided errors with pinprick and proprioception . Cerebellar exam finger to nose was with mild dysmetria , exaggerated on tracking ; rapid alternating movements normal , heel to shin was good with few errors . LABORATORY DATA Chest xray showed expanded lungs with biapical pulmonary opacities . EKG left bundle branch block . Urinalysis was unremarkable . **PHI** 27 , with a creatinine of **PHI** , glucose was 182 , but otherwise electrolytes were normal . Her admitting hematocrit was 45 %, **PHI** count 7,700 , with **PHI** MCV of 92 , platelets were normal at 263,000 . Albumin 2.5 . HOSPITAL COURSE # 1. cerebrovascular accident . The patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery . This was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial **PHI** . The possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor . Her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present . Previous echoes have shown MVP at the **PHI** Hospital . Her Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable . The patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization . She was anticoagulated with heparin and after several **PHI** Coumadin was started . Her exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will **PHI** something around 5 mg a day . Her pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge . She **PHI** to **PHI** **PHI** 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , **PHIDate** . In addition heparin should **PHI** started to drip on arrival at 400 units **PHI** hour . It is discontinued at the time of transport . The patient **PHI** received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete . During evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient **PHI** been too unsteady to ambulate . On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown . There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation **PHI** arisen . At the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient & apos ; s family strongly requested that she **PHI** transferred to the Sas **PHI** Hospital . What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia . Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain . Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions . Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast **PHI** . As I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her **PHI** status at the time . While mammogram and **PHI** 15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast **PHI** **PHI** reared its head . Two possible markers are anti Hu syndrome and anti Yo antibody . These tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge . The results can **PHI** obtained by paging me , Do A. **PHI** , M.D . at **PHI** . I will **PHI** happy to furnish the results . The patient **PHI** a history of MI in 1989 . Echocardiogram **PHI** longer shows wall motion abnormalities . EKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows **PHI** anterolateral Q wave inversion . We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this . Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to **PHI** performed . The patient **PHI** a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years . It **PHI** been evaluated in the past without success . During her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2 %. Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia . Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal . This is a chronic problem but **PHI** **PHI** contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk . Florinef is to **PHI** considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal . The patient **PHI** a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia . In addition there is a distant history of M. **PHI** infection . This **PHI** been evaluated by Dr. **PHI** at Sas **PHI** Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray . CT at the **PHI** Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings . A chest CT was to **PHI** performed and **PHI** **PHI** yielding . A PPD was placed and is to **PHI** read on Saturday , 4 26th . The left volar forearm **PHI** the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa . The patient **PHI** a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin . **PHI** of her lower extremities were negative on this admission . It is doubtful that she **PHI** chronic PE , but this is one consideration . It is likely that she **PHI** pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration . The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 . We think this is likely due to **PHI** SIADH as she is euvolemic . This can **PHI** evaluated further and is not a problem at this time . The patient **PHI** glaucoma . Her medications are as listed below . Her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .

His prothrombin time was 11.3 , and partial thromboplastin time of 31.4 . electrocardiogram showed some intermittent premature ventricular contractions and ST wave changes . **PHI** was transferred **PHI** additional unit of autologous packed cells in the recovery room and **PHI** additional unit of autologous blood was hung to **PHI** transfused on the floor . Over the next 24 hours , his **PHI** drain put out small amounts of serous sanguinous fluid , and was removed without difficulty . **PHI** was transfused 1 additional unit of banked blood the evening of surgery . **PHI** underwent serial hematocrit determinations throughout the rest of the hospital stay . On postoperative day 1 , his hematocrit was 29.1 , the next day it was 26.5 . On **PHIDate** , his hematocrit stabilized at 29.6 , and **PHI** received **PHI** additional transfusion . For management of pain postoperatively , **PHI** was placed on the PCA Morphine pump . This provided excellent relief of his incisional pain . **PHI** was gradually weaned off the intravenous Morphine , and switched over to oral analgesics with good control of his pain . Prior to discharge , **PHI** was switched over to Percocet , which provided excellent relief of his pain , and **PHI** was discharged with a prescription for Percocet . Postoperatively , **PHI** was placed in balance suspension , and kept at bedrest for two **PHI** when **PHI** was then mobilized , and started gait training , using a walker , and then crutches . Prior to discharge , **PHI** was independent in ambulation with crutches , as well as transfers . With the history of electrocardiogram changes in the recovery room , the patient was seen in consult by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** , of Cardiology . Dr. **PHI** found the at the electrocardiogram was consistent , but not diagnostic with mild ischemia . The patient **PHI** had **PHI** prior history of coronary artery disease , and the absence of significant ST depressions , **PHI** found the findings of only mild concern . **PHI** was placed on **PHI** **PHIDate** & **PHI** ; q6h . **PHI** was placed on the cardiac monitor for 36 hours , and had CPK isoenzyme determinations . The patient & apos ; s electrocardiogram returned to normal , **PHI** had **PHI** evidence or episodes , of ischemia or chest pain , in the perioperative , his CPK and isoenzymes showed **PHI** evidence of myocardial infarction . **PHI** was discontinued on **PHIDate** , and the patient was cleared by Dr. **PHI** , and **PHI** further Cardiology followup was required . Mr. **PHI** & apos ; s wound was checked daily , and found to **PHI** healing well without evidence for infection . On postoperative day number 10 , 2 **PHI** after the patient was discharged , the patient returned to the hospital for staple removal . The staples were removed , and steri strips were applied . The wound was found healing by primary intention , without evidence for infection . For prophylaxis against infection Mr. **PHI** was placed on Ancef perioperatively . This was continued for 72 hours postoperatively . For prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis , **PHI** was placed on Coumadin perioperatively . His daily dosage was adjusted according to his prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time . On postoperative day number 2 his prothrombin time was 13.3 , and partial thromboplastin time was 39.0 , and **PHI** received 5 mg of Coumadin . On postoperative day 3 , his prothrombin time was 14.9 , and his partial thromboplastin time was 40.6 , and **PHI** received 4 mg of Coumadin . On **PHIDate** , **PHI** underwent bilateral venous ultrasound of the lower extremities . This was negative for deep venous thrombosis bilaterally . His Coumadin was discontinued . Mr. **PHI** required intermittent straight cath for the first 48 hours postoperatively . Urine was sent for urinalysis , and culture and sensitivity , with this straight catheterization , and the urine culture and the urinalysis were negative . **PHI** was continued on intravenous Ancef for a total of 72 hours postoperatively , to cover him for the intermittent catheterizations . About 36 hours postoperatively , the patient was able to void spontaneously , and there **PHI** further intermittent catheterizations were required . Mr. **PHI** continued to progress well with his physical therapy . Prior to discharge **PHI** was ambulating independently with crutches , and on stairs , and was independent with transfers . **PHI** was discharged to home on postoperative day number 7 , **PHIDate** .

The electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per minute , with biphasic T & apos ; s in I , IV , V1 and T2 . ST depression and biphasic T & apos ; s were noted in V3 through V6 . **PHI** Q waves were noted . Picture was believed to **PHI** consistent with anteroseptal ischemia , right bundle branch block , and question of left bundle branch block . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital for further evaluation and definite treatment of his cardiac disease , as well as evaluation of his chronic renal insufficiency and multiple medical problems . **PHI** underwent numerous preoperative radiologic studies , including a transcranial Doppler , which revealed moderate to severe right PICA stenosis but **PHI** evidence of disease in the vertebrals , proximal basilars , posterior communicating arteries , middle cerebral arteries , anterior cerebral arteries , or ophthalmic systems . **PHI** also underwent a preoperative renal scan which showed decreased perfusion bilaterally , and borderline asymmetric renal function , 57 % left , 43 % right . The renal ultrasound revealed normal kidneys bilaterally with **PHI** evidence of hydronephrosis . The impression of the Renal consultant was that the patient & apos ; s renal function was likely secondary to mild ischemic acute tubular necrosis and hypoperfusion . **PHI** evidence of cholesterol emboli were noted . On **PHIDate** , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where **PHI** underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , reversed saphenous vein graft to circumflex , sequential reversed saphenous vein to acute marginal and posterior left ventricular artery .

The plan is to perform **PHI** urgent embolectomy . The risks and benefits have been explained to the patient and consent **PHI** been obtained . HOSPITAL COURSE On **PHIDate** at 12 00 midnight the patient was taken to the operating room . The preoperative diagnosis as above was a left brachial embolus . The postoperative diagnosis , the same . The procedure was a left brachial embolectomy . The surgeon was Dr. **PHI** and first assistant Dr. **PHI** . The findings were a thromboembolism with propagated clot in the left brachial artery . There were **PHI** complications . The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the floor soon after the procedure . On postoperative day # 1 the patient was afebrile with stable vitals and **PHI** had a very strong left radial pulse and a **PHI** hand . **PHI** was heparinized postoperatively and a cardiology consult was obtained . In addition echocardiography for the next day was arranged . The patient was seen on **PHIDate** by the **PHI** cardiology consult . His assessment was that this was a 76 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation and a dilated non ischemic cardiomyopathy status post two embolic thrombotic phenomena with a recent history of **PHI** upper gastrointestinal bleed . **PHI** recommended that the patient **PHI** heparinized as the **PHI** T Hospital Surgery Team had already done and that **PHI** **PHI** begun within a few **PHI** of heparinization . These recommendations were already underway . Consequently we simply continued our management . The cardiology consult also spoke to the patient & apos ; s primary medical doctor , **PHI**. **PHI** in Clear La who related that the patient had had two **PHI** esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia **PHI** in the past . On **PHIDate** the patient & apos ; s gastroenterologist Dr. **PHI** **PHI** was contacted . **PHI**. **PHI** was on vacation , however Dr. **PHI** , his partner was in the office and went through Mr. **PHI** & apos ; s old chart and noted that **PHI**. **PHI** had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his North **PHI** admission for **PHI** acute upper gastrointestinal bleed . During this time in **PHI** of **PHI** **PHI**. **PHI** had noted two distal esophageal ulcers . **PHI** had treated **PHI** of these with epinephrine injection . Follow up endoscopy on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in **PHI** . There was also a 4 cm . hiatus hernia from 36 cm . to 40 cm . The stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal . From **PHI**. **PHI** & apos ; s standpoint on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** there was **PHI** contraindication to **PHI** . We discussed **PHI** with **PHI**. **PHI** and noting **PHI**. **PHI** & apos ; s earlier findings we , in conjunction with **PHI**. **PHI** decided to Coumadinize the patient and **PHI** was begun on **PHIDate** . It was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when **PHI** had been Coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day . That was concurrent with Albuterol 150 mg. po q.day . **PHI** the patient & apos ; s history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on **PHIDate** . The findings were as follows . The principal operating surgeon was Dr. **PHI** **PHI** with the assistance of Dr. **PHI** . The principal findings were a 5.0 cm . hiatal hernia and apparent **PHI** and Ot of **PHI** Medical Center & apos ; s esophagus distally . In the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities . There were **PHI** abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum . The **PHI** impression was that there was **PHI** apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , **PHI** esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a Barrett & apos ; s esophagus . **PHI** biopsy was taken . The biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of Coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure . On **PHIDate** the patient went to the echocardiography suite . Findings were there was **PHI** evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a **PHI** echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus . There was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation . There was focal calcification in the mitral annulus . The aortic leaflets were thickened with **PHI** aortic stenosis . There was trace aortic insufficiency . The aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters . The left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection **PHI** n of 57 percent . There was trace tricuspid insufficiency . There was evidence of **PHI** old pacer wire in the right atrium . There was trace pulmonary insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters . There was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block . The patient , it should **PHI** noted at this time , was doing very well and **PHI** was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously . **PHI** had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by **PHIDate** his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate . On **PHIDate** **PHI** presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain . **PHI** confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently Rheumatology consult was obtained . The Rheumatologist entertained gout as **PHI** attractive diagnosis **PHI** his history and they aspirated the joint . Joint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo gout . Joint aspirate that was sent for culture **PHI** been negative to date and today is **PHIDate** . The rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification . A wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo gout . The patient & apos ; s pseudogout was treated with Colchicine 0.6 mg. po q . 3 hours and **PHI** received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms . **PHI** is being discharged on Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d . as **PHI** acute measure for his pseudo gout and that prescription will last until **PHI** sees **PHI**. **PHI** in follow up this coming Tuesday . Today , on **PHIDate** , the patient **PHI** **PHI** new complaint . Yesterday , on **PHIDate** , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued . Today his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of Coumadin per day is going to **PHI** a stable dose for him . Consequently , **PHI** is ready for discharge today . The only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with Coumadin his Ecotrin **PHI** been discontinued . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE Isordil 10 mg. PO t.i.d . Ditropan 5 mg. po q.i.d . Cimetidine 400 mg. PO b.i.d . Omeprazole 20 mg. PO b.i.d . Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d . Percocet 1 tablet po q . 4 to 6 hours prn and Coumadin 5 mg. po q.day .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the **PHI** of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention . At that time she was taken to the operating room and **PHI** ileostomy and colectomy performed . The admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four . The patient was referred then to the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital where she underwent thrombectomy . One month later the patient was readmitted to **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take down by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** . Thereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , **PHI** which she received six cycles and which was completed in **PHI** of **PHI** . This course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting . On **PHIDate** the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation . **PHI** abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis . Bilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge . Two **PHI** following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to **PHI** Center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia . She was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of Prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction . On this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home . She was then seen on **PHIDate** at **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted .

IN SUMMARY The patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with Adriamycin , **PHI** and MESNA . She also **PHI** a low grade fever of unknown etiology , **PHI** a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive . It was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was therefore admitted to the GYN Oncology **PHI** under the care of Dr. **PHI** . Laboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , **PHI** and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively . Urinalysis showed 10 20 **PHI** blood cells . In view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief . Repeat chest x ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia . Renal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized . Dr. **PHI** R. **PHI** from the Urology **PHI** was consulted in view of the above findings . **PHI** requested a Lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high grade obstruction of **PHI** kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with Lasix . Neither kidney appeared to **PHI** completely obstructed . In view of these results with the elevated **PHI** blood count , elevated creatinine , Dr. **PHI** felt that the patient was inadequately stented . As a result she was taken back to the operating room on **PHIDate** and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed . The patient was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out Escherichia **PHI** sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x ray . She was started on nebulizers around the clock and chest physical therapy . Sputum culture was sent but failed to identify **PHI** infective organism . On the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement . Her urinary output remained good at 80 100 ccs . per hour . However , her **PHI** and creatinine remained elevated . On **PHIDate** they were 21 and 2.2 respectively . Her Coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and **PHI** I and R of 2.5 3 . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** it was decided that Mrs. **PHI** was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle I chemotherapy with **PHI** , Adriamycin and MESNA . She was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy . In view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from Ancef and Gentamicin to Ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well . On **PHIDate** the patient was found to **PHI** mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise . Urinary electrolytes were noted to **PHI** within normal limits but her confusion persisted . A Neuro Oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to **PHI** intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped . **PHI** electroencephalogram was requested and was negative . **PHI** computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed . She continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with **PHI** amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs . for 24 hours . Off her **PHI** the patient & apos ; s sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted . For this reason a barium study was performed on **PHIDate** which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum . The mucosa appeared to **PHI** preserved . In addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon . The patient & apos ; s **PHI** blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on **PHIDate** and nadired down to 0.7 on **PHIDate** . The patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued . Her sensorium had cleared . Because of persistent nausea and vomiting on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** a KUB and upright was requested which showed **PHI** amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter . The patient & apos ; s **PHI** blood count persisted in the region of **PHI** to .6 with **PHI** **PHI** of 60 for the next two to three **PHI** . In addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on **PHIDate** . She was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and GCSF therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia . Despite the low platelets the patient showed **PHI** evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused . A Gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on **PHIDate** but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting . On conservative therapy the patient & apos ; s nausea and vomiting **PHI** slowly subsided . A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( **PHI** ) tube was placed on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** which **PHI** helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting . On **PHIDate** in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , **PHI** count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 . And she was not **PHI** platelets in addition . Throughout this period the patient & apos ; s pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia . After much discussion with the family and Social Services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** a PICC line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) and on **PHIDate** this was found to **PHI** correctly positioned on chest x ray . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** the patient was found to **PHI** mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting . The **PHI** tube was found to **PHI** draining well . She was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family . In addition she will **PHI** followed by **PHI** Center and **PHI** Center who will arrange for home PCA ( patient controlled analgesia ). The patient & apos ; s prognosis is guarded . Her current code status is do not resuscitate ( DNR ). MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE **PHI** omeprazole 20 mg. P.O . q.d . , Timoptic eye drops .5 percent one drop OU b.i.d .

A head CT performed on **PHIDate** revealed **PHI** cerebrovascular accident and **PHI** evidence of acute blood . MRA MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm . in width . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on **PHIDate** . This revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm . origin on the left . This was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm . The internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis . After much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended . The **PHI** underwent coiling on **PHIDate** . This showed that 60 70 % of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils . One coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm . It was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe . Also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism . Therefore the lowest **PHI** risk was thought to **PHI** a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil . Therefore after discussion in detail with **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on **PHIDate** . At this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic . Therefore **PHI** clip was possible and the **PHI** underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm . The patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name . Her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed . Her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. **PHI** is **PHI** 84 year old man who was admitted with decompensated heart failure . The patient **PHI** a long standing history of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis . **PHI** was recently hospitalized at the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital for repeat cardiac catheterization . After a comprehensive assessment , Drs . **PHI** and **PHI** did not recommend operative repair of severe mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis . **PHI** was thus discharged with plans for continued medical therapy of his coronary artery disease . Unfortunately , the patient continued to deteriorate and was readmitted for **PHI** attempt at hemodynamic **PHI** and possible inotropic support . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Is notable for above . For long standing dilated cardiomyopathy , severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 by previous catheterization . The patient had limited coronary artery disease with **PHI** occluded right coronary artery collateralized from the left system . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient was a well appearing pleasant man who was dyspneic on the examining table . Initial blood pressure was 95 65 , heart rate 80 and regular . Respiratory rate was 14 . Jugular venous pressure was 7 with modest hepatojugular reflex . The carotids were 2+ and the lungs were notable for diminished breath sounds with inspiratory rhonchi . The point of maximum impulse was displaced and the first and second heart sounds were unremarkable with a **PHIDate** murmur of mitral regurgitation . There was **PHI** S3 gallop . Abdomen was soft and non tender and the rest of the examination was notable only for a slightly diminished pulses and poor perfusion . LABORATORY DATA Notable for a sodium of 144 , potassium 3.7 , **PHI** 43 , creatinine 1.8 , albumin 3.0 , hematocrit 36 , **PHI** count 9.5 , platelet count 254 and a negative urinalysis . A chest x ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with modest edema and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation , previous inferior apical infarct and right bundle branch block . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of 11 , pulmonary artery pressure of 55 25 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 26 and a cardiac output of 2.7 liters per minute . The PA line was kept in place while the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where **PHI** underwent **PHI** attempt at hemodynamic **PHI** . Initially Nipride was begun with some augmentation of the cardiac index but eventually a fall of the cardiac index to 1.8 . The patient was then begun on Milrinone to a dose of .4 mcg . per kg . per minute with improvement in his cardiac index to approximately 2.0 and a corresponding fall in his filling pressures . Because of the increased ectopy that appeared to **PHI** temporally associated with this infusion , the patient was switched to Dobutamine and titrated to a dose of 250 mcg . per minute . On Dobutamine the cardiac index was 2.4 2.7 and at the end of his hemodynamic **PHI** which included vigorous diuresis and the addition of Isordil and Captopril back to his chronic medical program , the patient & apos ; s right atrial pressure was 6 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 9 and the cardiac index was 2.7 . Systemic vascular resistance was 900 . The patient was then decannulated and sent to the floor with improvement in his central hemodynamics . Over the subsequent **PHI** of his hospitalization , the patient had adjustment of his diuretic program . At discharge his goal weight will **PHI** 120 pounds and **PHI** will **PHI** maintained on a chronic Dobutamine infusion at 250 mcg . per minute . Should **PHI** tachy **PHI** to this which is inevitable , **PHI** will **PHI** begun on a home Milrinone infusion per previous protocol . The patient on the dose of Dobutamine noted , had little in the way of resting symptoms and was without paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea and able to ambulate approximately 100 150 feet without dyspnea .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. **PHI** is **PHI** 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization . Over the last four to five months , Mr. **PHI** **PHI** noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea . **PHI** **PHI** not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator . Although in the past , **PHI** **PHI** been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , **PHI** the decline in his functional capacity , **PHI** agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery . The patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to **PHI** less and less active unfortunately . **PHI** **PHI** nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising . **PHI** does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION On examination , the patient was **PHI** extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age . His blood pressure was 110 70 . **PHI** was 82 and regular . Respiratory rate was 16 . His jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+. Lungs were notable for adequate air movement with **PHI** rales . The first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced . There was **PHI** S3 gallop at the apex and a **PHIDate** murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla . The abdomen was soft and nontender . There was **PHI** organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex . The extremities were without edema and were **PHI** and well perfused . The posterior tibialis pulses were intact . LABORATORY DATA Sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , **PHI** 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 . Albumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , **PHI** count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds . The chest X ray revealed cardiomegaly and **PHI** significant congestion . The ECG was paced . **PHI** outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 **PHI** . , **PHI** LV of 60 **PHI** . , ejection fraction of 26 %, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of **PHI** cms . squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , **PHI** ejection fraction of 26 % with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis . There was mild tricuspid insufficiency , **PHI** estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56 22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared . The aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms . squared . Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals . Left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and **PHI** ejection fraction of 18 %. There was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the views . In addition , there was a 60 % lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself . The patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications . The patient was seen in consultation by **PHI**. **PHI** **PHI** of the Cardiac Surgery **PHI** and after a long discussion with the patient , Dr. **PHI** and the patient & apos ; s family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently **PHI** the patient & apos ; s age , co morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease . While in hospital , the patient was seen by **PHI** **PHI** who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to **PHI** modest . The patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71 %. The patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8 12 cms . of water as tolerated as **PHI** outpatient .

In addition , Mr. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm . by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis . His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz **PHI** proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative . The patient lives on **PHI** with his wife . **PHI** is a non smoker and drinks rare alcohol . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age . **PHI** pressure was 155 60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 . Mr. **PHI** was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen . Jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent . There was **PHI** thyromegaly . Carotids were 2+. **PHI** sounds were decreased at the **PHI** only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with **PHI** like radiation to the apex . Abdomen soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations . There was **PHI** rash and **PHI** edema and the neurological examination was non focal . LABORATORY DATA Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , **PHI** 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , **PHI** count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds . The urinalysis was negative . The Troponin I was less than **PHI** and the creatine kinase was 114 . Chest x ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with **PHI** clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and or scarring at **PHI** lung **PHI** . The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent **PHI** approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations . After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would **PHI** prudent . Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung . Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D dimer test were **PHI** negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent . It was not felt that the patient would **PHI** in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto . Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant **PHI** in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries . After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute . Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. **PHI** most likely **PHI** multi factorial dyspnea owing to **PHI** his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state . In Hospital **PHI** was seen by **PHI** Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the **PHI** **PHI** Medical Center Congestive **PHI** Failure Nurse Practitioner Program . His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .

In addition , Mr. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm . by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis . His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz **PHI** proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative . The patient lives on **PHI** with his wife . **PHI** is a non smoker and drinks rare alcohol . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age . **PHI** pressure was 155 60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 . Mr. **PHI** was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen . Jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent . There was **PHI** thyromegaly . Carotids were 2+. **PHI** sounds were decreased at the **PHI** only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with **PHI** like radiation to the apex . Abdomen soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations . There was **PHI** rash and **PHI** edema and the neurological examination was non focal . LABORATORY DATA Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , **PHI** 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , **PHI** count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds . The urinalysis was negative . The Troponin I was less than **PHI** and the creatine kinase was 114 . Chest x ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with **PHI** clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and or scarring at **PHI** lung **PHI** . The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent **PHI** approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations . After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would **PHI** prudent . Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung . Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D dimer test were **PHI** negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent . It was not felt that the patient would **PHI** in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto . Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant **PHI** in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries . After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute . Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. **PHI** most likely **PHI** multi factorial dyspnea owing to **PHI** his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state . In Hospital **PHI** was seen by **PHI** Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the **PHI** **PHI** Medical Center Congestive **PHI** Failure Nurse Practitioner Program . His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .

SOCIAL HISTORY She is a one pack per day smoker for the last forty years , denies alcohol , is a former nurse with the Storm Mor Hospital And Medical Center . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Her blood pressure was 190 90 when I first saw her on her second hospital day . She was afebrile , in sinus rhythm , pulse 60 . Neck supple . Lungs clear . **PHI** regular rate and rhythm , without ectopy . A II VI systolic ejection murmur is at the base , minimal radiation to the carotids . Abdomen soft , without hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities normal pulses , **PHI** clubbing , cyanosis or edema . The neurological examination post angiogram her eyes were closed . She was very responsive , somewhat sleepy , she complained of chest pain , which was diffuse , non localizing without electrocardiogram changes and persisted for several **PHI** and then went away completely . She was oriented to person , place , time and purpose , she recalled three out of three objects at five minutes , she is able to do calculations . She maintained her fixation on the conversation well . The cranial nerve exam pupils reactive to light , extra ocular movements show good upgaze up to 3 mm . , good down gaze . Right lateral gaze , the right eye had 2 mm . of sclera showing , the left eye was normal , and there are a few beats of right beading nystagmus . The left lateral gaze , the left eye had 1 mm . of lateral sclera showing . Disks were flat . Sensory limb of the right eye corneal reflex is slowed , otherwise normal . Seventh nerve weakness on the right in a central pattern is present . Soft palate was in the midline and moved upward nicely , but did not respond to gag . Tongue protrudes 2 cm . with slight deviation to the right . Sensory exam was not remarkable , cerebellar exam was not possible . Motor exam showed greater than 4+ strength bilateral upper extremities and psoas unable to lift off bed . **PHI** 2+ on the left and 3+ on the right . **PHI** . 3 on the left and 4+ on the right . Tibialis 3 on the left , 5+ on the right . Reflexes were diffuse 3+, toes upgoing bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA On admission , electrocardiogram showed less than 1 mm . of ST depression in V4 to V6 , which is likely the patient & apos ; s baseline . CK & apos ; s were mildly elevated but the MB fractions were not remarkable . A chest X ray showed some left lower lobe atelectasis . Admitting creatinine was **PHI** , glucose 131 , **PHI** blood count was 10,000 , hematocrit was 40 , liver enzymes normal range . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram . She was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin . A small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae . She was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on **PHIDate** , she had **PHI** acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis . This was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function . For a short time , she seemed & **PHI** ; locked in & **PHI** ;. She **PHI** made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge **PHI** 4 strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand . Trace movement of the right elbow and 4 strength of the right wrist and hand . 4 to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle . She is unable to lift either foot off the bed . The extra ocular movements are full . Tongue protrudes 4 cm . She is drowsy at **PHI** , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to . She **PHI** severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences . She **PHI** been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement . She is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this **PHI** been stable . She is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members . Follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery . The patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising **PHI** blood counts . A chest X ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate . Initially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen . Sputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 **PHI** intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ). A left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to **PHI** sterile , and without evidence of empyema . The patient is on Ciprofloxacin . The day of discharge is day # 3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should **PHI** totally discontinued . She **PHI** developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five **PHI** a day . She also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth . Once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol **PHI** **PHI** helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics . She **PHI** been afebrile for greater than 10 **PHI** , including several **PHI** on oral antibiotics . The patient & apos ; s liver enzymes were noted to **PHI** elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three **PHI** normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT . These have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge . A right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis . The exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver . The patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization . **PHI** studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with **PHI** as well as multiple phlebotomies . The plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron . The patient & apos ; s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion . This is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received . This must **PHI** carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium . The patient **PHI** had low sodiums during this hospitalization . This **PHI** due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this . Her sodiums were never below 130 . She does well with tube feeds . Her tube feeds orders are as follow full strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc . per hour . In addition , the **PHI** gets 250 cc . of juice ( not water ) three **PHI** a day . She also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds . She also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day . Please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great **PHI** from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon . It is for this reason that she is discharged with **PHI** nasogastric tube and that **PHI** plans for G tube placement are made at this time . She **PHI** a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that **PHI** not been worked up . She did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes . In the first week of **PHI** , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with **PHI** increase in the LDH , but not CK . This did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time . As of **PHIDate** , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is **PHI** evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent . Her cholesterol was 350 here . She **PHI** been off of her **PHI** medicines . These can **PHI** restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes . Note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines . **PHI** ON **PHI** Metamucil 1 teaspoon q.d . , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc . down nasogastric tube t.i.d . , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as above , Tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , Nystatin swish and spit 10 cc . five **PHI** a day , Cardizem slow release 90 mg.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of **PHI** anterior myocardial infarction i **PHI** **PHI** and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on **PHIDate** with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . **PHI** had **PHI** prior cardiac history until **PHI** **PHI** when on 5 24 **PHI** had crushing **PHI** pain which radiated to his left arm . **PHI** was found at that time to have 3 4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health . The patient was transferred to **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital and had 4 7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q & apos ; s in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1 2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F. On physical examination at that time **PHI** had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and **PHI** was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab . The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29 16 , RV 33 8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 . **PHI** had a 95 % proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA & apos ; d to a residual of 30 % and **PHI** intra aortic balloon pump was placed . **PHI** also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time . The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where **PHI** had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7 % MB & apos ; s . His intra aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems . **PHI** had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started . On day six , **PHI** echocardiogram showed **PHI** ejection fraction of 44 % with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis . On day nine , **PHI** had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium . Therefore , **PHI** went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM . The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. **PHI** of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. **PHI** of Cardiology and Dr. **PHI** of **PHI** **PHI** Memorial Hospital . However , **PHI** did not keep any of these appointments . **PHI** went home and did not take any of his **PHI** and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months . On the a.m. of **PHIDate** , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . **PHI** came to the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital Emergency **PHI** where **PHI** was noted to **PHI** ashen and diaphoretic . **PHI** was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen . CARDIAC RISK FACTORS His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY His past medical history included hypertension and **PHI** insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY His past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy . **PHI** ON ADMISSION On admission , **PHI** was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but **PHI** was not taking either of these **PHI** . HABITS The patient smokes one pack per day and **PHI** a history of heavy alcohol use . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110 70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 . The HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact . The pupils equal , round , reactive to light . The oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal . There were **PHI** hypertensive or diabetic changes . The neck was suppled , with **PHI** lymphadenopathy and **PHI** jugular venous distention . The carotids were 1+ without bruits . The heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . The lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly . The abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds . The liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender . There was **PHI** splenomegaly . The femoral pulses were diminished . **PHI** had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae . The extremities revealed **PHI** clubbing , cyanosis or edema . The pulses were 1+ bilaterally . The skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo . The rectal examination was guaiac negative . LABORATORY DATA The laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , **PHI** and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 . The portable chest X ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm . The electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R wave progression consistent with **PHI** old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T waves in V1 through V5 , which were of **PHI** significant change since his last EKG on **PHIDate** . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol . **PHI** was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin . **PHI** beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110 70 . The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9 % MB fraction . This was a **PHI** Q wave myocardial infarction as there were **PHI** diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . on **PHIDate** , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA & apos ; d , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the **PHI** . The left ventriculogram revealed **PHI** akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle . **PHI** the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient . **PHI** was ambulated progressively on the floor . A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid . The patient ambulated extensively on the **PHI** 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath . On **PHIDate** , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging . This treadmill test was done on **PHI** , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess **PHI** amount of ischemia on treatment . The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , **PHI** did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while **PHI** was on the beta blockade . There were **PHI** diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although **PHI** did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF . The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was **PHI** **PHI** pain . Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle . There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test . These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in **PHI** **PHI** . After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. **PHI** , and Dr. **PHI** , it was elected to **PHI** the patient to home with medical management . The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although **PHI** understands that this **PHI** become necessary in the future . Dr. **PHI** had a long discussion with the patient & apos ; s daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient & apos ; s compliance . Previously **PHI** had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments . The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient . She will **PHI** actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. **PHI** as well as Dr. **PHI** on the outside . The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization . Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done . **PHI** will need to **PHI** followed up as **PHI** out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future . **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male whose cardiac risk factors **PHI** hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use and a positive family history . **PHI** was a previously healthy male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission . On the night prior to admission **PHI** was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9 30 p.m . **PHI** was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2 45 a.m. on **PHIDate** **PHI** electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 . **PHI** was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine . **PHI** was transferred to **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital hemodynamically stable . **PHI** arrived in the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120 80 , heart rate 90 . **PHI** electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions . It was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF . The initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum . **PHI** was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip . Because of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Notable only for surgical repair of **PHI** ulcer and a remote appendectomy . **PHI** ON ADMISSION None ALLERGIES Penicillin , which gives him a rash . SOCIAL HISTORY His habits **PHI** smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient was **PHI** elderly appearing male in **PHI** significant distress . His pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114 70 . The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable . The neck was supple . The carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits . On cardiac examination **PHI** had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet S1 and S2 , **PHI** murmurs . **PHI** had **PHI** audible S3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 . On lung examination **PHI** had rales one third up bilaterally . His abdomen was soft and nontender with **PHI** hepatosplenomegaly , **PHI** guarding and **PHI** rebound . On rectal examination **PHI** had bright red blood in the vault without any stool . His extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema . LABORATORY DATA The hematocrit was 44.9 , **PHI** blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , CO2 27.4 , **PHI** 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 . The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , ST elevations in V4 through V6 , I and aVL , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with Q waves in V1 to V3 and reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and **PHI** . The **PHI** X ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and **PHI** elevated left hemidiaphragm . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33 8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29 16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 . **PHI** had a proximal 95 % left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal . The left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30 % residual stenosis . **PHI** intra aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically . The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the **PHI** . On hospital day 2 the intra aortic balloon pump was weaned . The patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with Serax . The Lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well . On the third hospital day the intra aortic balloon pump was removed . The intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off . After removal of the intra aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated . On the fourth hospital day **PHI** attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor . However , after a **PHI** dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient & apos ; s blood pressure dropped to the 60 40 range and **PHI** was therefore kept in the **PHI** . The peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7 % MB fraction . On the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor . Once on the floor the patient had **PHI** recurrent chest pain . **PHI** echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated **PHI** ejection fraction of 44 %. On transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool . **PHI** was evaluated by the GI **PHI** who felt that , **PHI** the patient & apos ; s course , **PHI** could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future . The **PHI** underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day . **PHI** exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80 % of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol . **PHI** did not have **PHI** pain . There were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery . The thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution . Based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel . These findings were considered not to **PHI** hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to **PHI** discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin . Because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100 70 , **PHI** **PHI** inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to **PHI** continued .

Cardiovascular exam grade I VI systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border , **PHI** S1 , S2 . The rectal examination showed guaiac negative stool . Extremities within normal limits . The neurological examination showed **PHI** absent left knee jerk . Cerebellar function was normal . LABORATORY DATA significant for a sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 105 , **PHI** and creatinine 21 and 1.5 , LDH 732 , SGOT 84 , alkaline phosphatase 145 , bilirubin 0.3 , calcium 10 , albumen 4.1 , globulin 3.9 , **PHI** blood count 8.9 , hematocrit 43.3 , 62 polys , 26 lymphs , 9 monos , 1 eo , 2 basos , prothrombin time 9 . **PHI** , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 . During this admission , **PHI** upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow through on **PHIDate** was normal . A computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid **PHI** and **PHI** evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe . **PHI** scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases . A magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed **PHI** definite evidence of metastatic deposits . There was microvascular disease . A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological . Spleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits . A magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed **PHI** metastases . The magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases . There was **PHI** evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the L4 nerve root . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted and **PHI** was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the L4 spine region . The first course of chemotherapy was **PHI** from **PHIDate** through **PHIDate** . This was VP 16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with Zofran 11 mg on three occasions as **PHI** antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of Decadron . The chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia . Granulocyte colony stimulating factor was added . Thus **PHI** blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8 27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , **PHI** blood count recovered . Actually the lowest **PHI** blood count was 0.5 on **PHIDate** . On that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 . By **PHIDate** , the **PHI** blood count was back up to 16.2 . The patient & apos ; s course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain . **PHI** is on MS Contin and also on Duragesic patch . **PHI** continued to have nausea and vomiting . The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. **PHI** of Gastroenterology . Eventually , a PICC line was inserted and **PHI** was **PHI** central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy . Two weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved . It was felt that endoscopy would **PHI** of value . A central venous line was placed on **PHIDate** . After neutropenia resolved by **PHIDate** with **PHI** blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible . This was done on **PHIDate** and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared . Cytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative . The patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any Monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of Monilia . Gradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat . **PHI** was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was **PHI** at lower dose . **PHI** received VP 16 100 mg daily x three , 9 12 , 9 13 and **PHIDate** , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg . The only problem was some recurrent nausea . The radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , **PHIDate** , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting . His **PHI** blood count was in the range of 53,000 because Neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will **PHI** continued until it is clear that **PHI** **PHI** passed the nadir of any neutropenia to **PHI** expected from this cycle of chemotherapy . **PHI** DIAGNOSIS 1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and **PHI** , 2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor , 3. intractable nausea and vomiting , 4. pain syndrome , largely resolved , 5. hypertension . **PHI** ON **PHI** Prilosec 20 mg PO qa.m . , Senokot one to two tablets PO q.day as needed , Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d . , **PHI** 100,000 units swish and swallow four **PHI** a day , Darvocet N 100 1 PO q4h prn pain , Cardizem 240 mg PO q.day , Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.day x ten **PHI** , depending on trend of blood counts , Compazine 10 mg PO q6h prn nausea , PICC line flushes , 200 units of heparin twice daily .

Urinary tract infection . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital on **PHIDate** with progressive weakness , weight loss and shortness of breath . The patient was in a good state of health until **PHI** of **PHI** when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue . She had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months . Although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to **PHI** resolving , her weakness persisted . A work up begun by her internist , **PHI**. **PHI** , revealed a **PHI** blood cell count of 49,000 with 50 % eosinophils . She was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing **PHI** for further evaluation . Data collected there included a chest x ray which was unremarkable . The liver function tests showed **PHI** alkaline phosphatase of 303 , LDH 310 , SGOT 66 , albumin 2.5 . A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers . Chromosomal studies were negative . A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of **PHI** old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area . A thyroid ultrasound showed **PHI** inferior thyroid mass . This was followed by **PHI** abdominal CT which showed **PHI** enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst . Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid . **PHI** upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable . The small bowel follow through was within normal limits . A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side . A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly . The patient was subsequently referred to the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital under the service of **PHI**. **PHI** . She continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss . She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion . A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a pleasant , elderly female in **PHI** acute distress . Her **PHI** **PHI** showed a blood pressure of 126 72 , pulse 84 , respirations 22 , temperature 98.6 . She had a 3 x 4 cm firm , nontender right thyroid mass that seemed to **PHI** fixed to the trachea . She had **PHI** jugular venous distention or bruits . The lungs exhibited right basilar dullness one quarter of the way up . She had **PHI** definite S3 . The liver edge was palpable to 6 cm below the right costal margin . Her spleen could not **PHI** palpated . She had 4+ edema to the knees bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA On admission the **PHI** blood count was 67.3 with a differential of 21 % polys , 16 % bands , 3 % lymphocytes , 2 % monocytes , 57 % eosinophils and 1 % myelocytes . Her hematocrit was 38.8 , hemoglobin 13.7 , platelet count 155,000 , PT 12.7 10.1 , PTT 33.9 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 , calcium 7.5 , phosphorus 3.5 , sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , **PHI** 15 , total protein 5.9 , albumin 2.3 , globulin 3.6 , alkaline phosphatase 379 , SGOT 37 , Digoxin level 0.7 . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to Dr. **PHI** S **PHI** on **PHIDate** with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement . Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper eosinophilic syndrome . Accordingly , **PHI** Oncology consult was called on **PHIDate** and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed . This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation . A lung biopsy was performed on **PHIDate** without definitive results . During this time the patient & apos ; s coagulation status had improved with **PHI** K therapy with PTs normalizing . ANCA serum results were negative . ANA results were also nonsuggestive . The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein . There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well . A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain . Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun . Meanwhile , the patient & apos ; s eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone . She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to **PHI** , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea . The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases . Dr. **PHI** was subsequently consulted on **PHIDate** for surgical intervention . On **PHIDate** the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland . She underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .

The patient is now admitted for elective replacement of her pulse generator due to end of life . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT The patient underwent successful replacement of her pulse generator . This procedure was quite complicated , required intubation during [] anesthesia due to respiratory compromise , and was technically challenging ; however , preexistent leads did not show any problems , and the patient received new Medtronic [] pulse generator . The DFT was less than 24 joules . The patient was extubated successfully and recovered uneventfully . Final settings of her device **PHI** ejection fraction detection at the rate of 182 beats per minutes , therapy for this is 34 joules x 6 , VT detection between 160 182 beats per minute , therapy for this is 10 joules x 1 and 34 joules x 4 . **PHI** is set in the backup mode at the rate of 40 beats per minute .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS Urinary tract infection , tracheostomy status , diabetes mellitus . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. **PHI** was transferred from the **PHI** **PHI** I **PHI** University Medical Center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis . His only positive result was a sputum culture for Pseudomonas and this came after **PHI** had already been on antibiotics . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The physical examination on transfer showed **PHI** alert male with temperature 100 degrees , blood pressure 120 64 , heart rate 80 . **PHI** was intubated with pressor support of 25 , and PEEP of 12.5 with 70 % FIO2 . Tracheostomy tube was in good position . There was **PHI** audible air leak . His chest showed bilateral rhonchi . The abdomen was distended with active bowel sounds . The rectal examination was unremarkable . Extremities showed trace pulmonary edema . LABORATORY DATA A chest X ray showed diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates , greater in the lower lung **PHI** than in the upper . The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 83 , with **PHI** 11 degree axis , **PHI** specific ST T wave changes . The sputum Gram stain showed a few polys and **PHI** organisms . The blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , pCO2 of 48 and pH of 7.47 . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. **PHI** who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and **PHI** was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it . **PHI** also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky . The patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas **PHI** was known to have . The steroids were tapered . **PHI** was also begun on anti Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen . Because of the story of hemoptysis , **PHI** also underwent **PHI** exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner & apos ; s and Goodpasture & apos ; s . These results were all negative . **PHI** continued to require very high FIO2 . **PHI** was found to have a DVT by ultrasound . **PHI** underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin . This produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion . **PHI** stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement . In consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done . At that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine . **PHI** J .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. **PHI** is a 45 year old gentleman with Down & apos ; s syndrome , who presents to the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital with jaundice . Mr. **PHI** **PHI** a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years . A recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done . A right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in **PHI** of **PHI** . This study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation . Subsequently , **PHI** oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study . The patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital . At operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder . The surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted . Since that time , the patient **PHI** had increasing jaundice , but **PHI** nausea or vomiting . It should **PHI** noted that the patient **PHI** experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently . The patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although **PHI** was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1 ) Down & apos ; s syndrome , 2 ) intestinal malrotation , 3 ) status post Ladd & apos ; s procedure , 4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as **PHI** infant .

His head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head . His pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck . Examination of the back reveals **PHI** costovertebral angle tenderness . Examination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation . Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a **PHIDate** systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a **PHIDate** decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb & apos ; s point , with **PHI** gallop or rub appreciated . The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended . There are **PHI** palpable masses , and there is **PHI** shake tenderness . There is a well healed right subcostal scar , and a well healed right paramedian scar . Rectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac negative stool . Extremities **PHI** clubbing , cyanosis or edema . Neurological examination is nonfocal . LABORATORY DATA A panel of serum electrolytes is normal . The **PHI** blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 . Lymphocyte differential count shows 77 % **PHI** , 13 % lymphocytes , 8 % monocytes , and 1 % basophils . Alkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 . Total bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 . Total protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 . **PHI** amylase is 43 . Calcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 . X ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart . KUB and upright abdominal x rays revealed **PHI** obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which **PHI** represent gall stones . Ultrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma . Intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass . Electrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with **PHI** specific ST and T wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF . The axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital to the **PHI** Surgery **PHI** of Dr. **PHI** **PHI** . A modified upper GI x ray series was obtained , which revealed **PHI** of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but **PHI** evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified . Therefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed . This study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct . A temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning . The patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were **PHI** complications . **PHI** was returned to the Surgical **PHI** in stable condition . Because of the probable malignant nature of the patient & apos ; s biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on **PHIDate** , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed . This procedure was performed under **PHI** anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct . Additionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass . These procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication . As before , the patient was covered with post procedure antibiotic therapy . **PHI** was returned to the surgical **PHI** in stable condition . Preliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but **PHI** malignant cells . However , two cytology specimens were **PHI** positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma . Following the permanent stent placement , the patient & apos ; s diet was slowly advanced . His serum bilirubin **PHI** and other liver function studies continued to normalize . Because of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that **PHI** surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on **PHIDate** .

Unsigned DIS Report **PHI** Unsigned ADMISSION DATE **PHIDate** **PHI** DATE **PHIDate** PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS Severe blunt abdominal trauma . ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS 1 . Grade II V laceration of liver , 2. rupture of left renal vein , 3. tear of transverse mesocolon , 4. serosal tear of transverse colon , 5. blunt fracture of the neck of the pancreas . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE Mr. **PHI** was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by **PHI** intoxicated driver . The patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over , possibly over him . **PHI** was found awake at the scene , complaining of abdominal pain . **PHI** had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Hospital **PHI** . Intravenous fluids was **PHI** . **PHI** was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated , and a 14 **PHI** catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds . **PHI** arrived at the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital at 02 30 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 . **PHI** bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins , bilateral chest tubes were placed , and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid . **PHI** had **PHI** ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended . His hematocrit was 36 , and creatinine 1.6 . The abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood . His blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as **PHI** was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table ; the scan was aborted and **PHI** was taken directly to the operating room at 03 00 . At laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity . There was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a **PHI** central retroperitoneal hematoma . Control of the super celiac aorta was obtained , and **PHI** left and right sided & **PHI** ; **PHI** & **PHI** ; maneuvers were performed . The retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting . This was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava . The vein was divided and suture ligated . Bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures . The tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired . The examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed **PHI** other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal . The patient was now very stable , and **PHI** was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit . The patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer & apos ; s lactate . **PHI** intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery **PHI** staff during the laparotomy . Intracranial pressures were normal . That day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal . **PHI** arch aortogram was normal . Over the ensuing twenty four hours , bilateral infiltrates on **PHI** X ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed . The patient had a **PHI** fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a **PHI** amylase of 1265 . **PHI** was returned to the operating room on **PHI** **PHI** . Three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity . Exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels . Because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux en Y drainage was feasible . Four **PHI** flat **PHI** **PHI** drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian **PHI** catheter were placed . The patient & apos ; s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that **PHI** was **PHI** longer on pressors . However , upon transfer from the operating room table to the **PHI** bed , **PHI** suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32 88 6.92 . **PHI** was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and **PHI** was taken to the **PHI** . Continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on **PHI** **PHI** , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient & apos ; s course . Vancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were **PHI** for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid . **PHI** was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome . Total parenteral nutrition was started on **PHI** **PHI** . Initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the **PHI** **PHI** drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation . The patient was returned to the operating room on **PHI** **PHI** , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided . It was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads . The abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration . **PHI** was returned to the operating room on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement . Tracheostomy was also performed on **PHI** **PHI** . There was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas . The subsequent **PHI** course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state . On **PHI** **PHI** , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the **PHI** ; this was repeated daily for the next three **PHI** . On **PHI** **PHI** , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support . His blood pressure gradually fell , and **PHI** died early on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . **PHI** DIAGNOSIS Severe blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .

In **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** noted **PHI** discomfort with exertion . **PHI** exercise tolerance test and stress Thallium showed septal and anterior wall ischemia . In **PHI** , **PHI** the patient developed shortness of breath and orthopnea . **PHI** echocardiogram at the time revealed left ventricular dilatation and septal **PHI** . The patient subsequently developed congestive heart failure which was treated with diuretics . On **PHIDate** the **PHI** underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed a right coronary artery that had serial stenosis , and left anterior descending artery that had a long complex proximal lesion and a circumflex which had its first obtuse marginal which was stenotic . The left ventriculogram showed global hypokinesis and preserved left ventricular function with mitral valve prolapse without regurgitation . The patient is thus admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting .

Cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2 with a I II VI late systolic murmur radiating to the apex . Lungs were clear . Abdomen was benign . Rectal guaiac negative , **PHI** lesions , smooth prostate . Vascular exam ; 2+ pulses throughout bilaterally without bruits . LABORATORY DATA On admission , **PHI** x ray revealed two nodular opacities that were projected over the left lung , one over the anterior aspect of the left fourth rib and the other over the interspace between the anterior sixth and seventh ribs . These were also seen on previous film . These were felt to **PHI** consistent with a granulomata . There was also a bipolar pacemaker present . Creatinine was 0.9 , **PHI** 13 , hematocrit was 40 . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the hospital on **PHIDate** and on the following day was taken to the operating room where **PHI** underwent a saphenous coronary artery bypass graft to the diagonal , circumflex marginal artery , and acute marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery . This operation was performed by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** . Intraoperative findings were as follows The pericardium was opened to reveal a heart that appeared essentially normal . The diagonal coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe . The circumflex marginal artery was small and only took a 1 millimeter probe tightly . The first main was anastomosed side to side to the diagonal and end to end to the circumflex marginal artery . The left anterior descending artery was then isolated , opened , probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe and anastomosed to the left internal mammary artery . The acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe tightly and a second main was anastomosed to this . The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on nitroglycerin at 50 mcg . per minute Levophed at 4 mcg . per minute and Lidocaine at 1 mg. r minute . The patient was extubated on postoperative day # 1 and transported to the routine postoperative care floor on postoperative day # 2 in good condition . The only issue of note during the patient & apos ; s **PHI** course was a small right apical pneumothorax which disappeared on repeat chest x ray . The other issue was that the Pacer Lab was consulted for **PHI** atrial sensing problem . The **PHI** setter 2022 Synchrony II was interrogated . It was found to have inadequate atrial sensing , even post re programming to the maximum sensitivity at 0.5 millivolts . **PHI** changes with unipolar ring or tip . The V **PHI** was changed from 0.6 millivolts 2.0 millivolts to 0.8 millivolts 4.0 millivolts . The V sensor was changed from 4 millivolts to 2 millivolts . It was felt that the atrial pacing would improve as the edema resolved . Meanwhile , the patient was AV paced using the epicardial **PHI** . While on the routine postoperative care floor the patient continued to progress well . Of note , **PHI** developed a small right apical pneumothorax which was followed on serial films and found to **PHI** stable and was not causing the patient any respiratory distress . Also , the Pacer **PHI** re programmed the patient & apos ; s cardiac pacer to a **PHI** mode with a rate of 60 beats per minute , **PHI** AV delay of 175 , a maximum track of 120 . The ventricular pulse configuration was bipolar with a V pulse width of **PHI** , a V pulse amplitude of 4.0 , a V sense configuration of bipolar , a V sensitivity of 2.0 and a V refractory of 250 . The atrial pulse configuration was bipolar with **PHI** A pulse width of **PHI** , **PHI** A pulse amplitude of 2.5 , **PHI** A sensed configuration that was bipolar , **PHI** A sensitivity that was **PHI** , **PHI** A refractory that was 325 . **PHI** was set at 38 , AV safety option was on enable , PVC options were on , PMT options were off , a rate respiratory AV delay was on enable , a magnet was temporary off . The **PHI** was 2.0 . The measured average sensor was 2.0 . The slope was 8 . The maximum sensory rate was 110 . The reaction time was fast , the recovery time was medium . The patient continued to progress well and was ultimately discharged on **PHIDate** in good condition . **PHI** DIAGNOSIS Coronary artery disease .

Upon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis . There were two **PHI** mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was **PHI** diagnostic . She was referred for tissue diagnosis and on **PHIDate** was brought to the operating room . She underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy . These were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy . Intraoperatively there was a **PHI** emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand . It was decided to perform reduction **PHI** . This proceeded uneventfully . She was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation . However , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had **PHI** arrest . This appeared to **PHI** respiratory in origin . She was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun . **PHI** were **PHI** and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate . Her blood pressure remained unstable requiring **PHI** amounts of pressors . X rays showed **PHI** pneumothorax and there was **PHI** bleeding from her chest tubes . She was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit . Early in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70 30 . Her wedge pressure was 20 and there were **PHI** electrocardiogram changes . She ruled out for myocardial infarction . She developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration . This improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures . She developed a right pleural effusion which required **PHI** tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw colored fluid . She remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide . Ultimately she was able to **PHI** weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide . However , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started . This improved her cardiac function . She failed to wean from the ventilator and on **PHIDate** was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy . She had a complicated course from **PHI** Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri . The right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri . She had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis . She was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics . **PHI** her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only . This was discussed with the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit staff . Her support was withdrawn and she expired on **PHIDate** at 9 00 p.m . The patient & apos ; s family was notified . **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE **PHIDate** Intra aortic balloon placement . **PHIDate** Intubation . Hemodialysis . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS This is a 56 year old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the **PHI** for further care for cardiogenic shock . Mr. **PHI** had **PHI** anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 . **PHI** had inferior myocardial infarction in **PHI** **PHI** . His course was complicated at that time by hypertension and **PHI** echocardiogram showed **PHI** LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 . In **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** had **PHI** out of hospital cardiac arrest . **PHI** rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time . **PHI** was transferred to the **PHI** where **PHI** underwent a work up of **PHI** his arrhythmia and his heart failure . **PHI** automatic implantable defibrillator was placed . **PHI** was thought to **PHI** a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis . Because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. **PHI** was thought not to **PHI** a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant . Mr. **PHI** waited as **PHI** outpatient for the availability of a donor heart . **PHI** was admitted to the hospital in late **PHI** with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea . Colonoscopy demonstrated severe **PHI** & apos ; s disease with sparing of the rectum . A perirectal fistula was seen . Treatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. **PHI** was discharged from the hospital ten **PHI** ago . On the evening of **PHI** **PHI** , Mr. **PHI** developed progressively worsening dyspnea . **PHI** presented to the **PHI** Medical Center emergency room on the morning of **PHI** **PHI** with hypertension and dyspnea . **PHI** was **PHI** intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated . Hypertension continued and **PHI** intra aortic balloon pump was placed . **PHI** is now being transferred to the **PHI** for further treatment . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Physical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80 56 and a heart rate of 124 . His CVP was 16 . **PHI** was on the balloon pump at the time . His chest was clear anteriorly . His cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop . **PHI** murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this . His abdomen was soft and **PHI** had **PHI** extremity edema . His feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA Admission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a **PHI** count of 25,700 . The sodium was 126 , the **PHI** 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 . Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with **PHI** intraventricular conduction defect . There were inferior Q waves consistent with **PHI** old infarct . The **PHI** x ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly . HOSPITAL COURSE Mr. **PHI** was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place . **PHI** was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine . It was noted that his intra aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. **PHI** was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump . After replacement of the intra aortic balloon pump , Mr. **PHI** remained critically **PHI** , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure . **PHI** did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 . It was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve . **PHI** also remained intubated . Mr. **PHI** was seen by Dr. **PHI** of the GI **PHI** for advice regarding his **PHI** & apos ; s disease . All of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to **PHI** contraindications to transplantation . As Mr. **PHI** did not have any bowel sounds , **PHI** did have to remain on nasogastric suction . **PHI** was seen in consultation by **PHI**. **PHI** of the Renal Unit . **PHI**. **PHI** felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a **PHI** effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement . Procainamide was begun in **PHI** effort to convert Mr. **PHI** to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation . Initially **PHI** was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently . As Mr. **PHI** & apos ; s renal function did not improve , **PHI** was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis . This resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine . **PHI** was able to get some fluid off as well . With getting some volume off , the patient & apos ; s ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters . His cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although **PHI** was on dobutamine as well . On **PHIDate** **PHI** effort was made to attempt to wean the intra aortic balloon pump . With a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , **PHI** developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index . The balloon pump was restored . **PHI** was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support . **PHI** continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output . Supportive care continued . Unfortunately , the **PHI** blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis . Broad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added . Mr. **PHI** & apos ; s blood pressure appeared to stabilize . Another effort was made on **PHIDate** to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to **PHI** increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and **PHI** was restored to full counterpulsation . **PHI** had been able to **PHI** transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but **PHI** had to **PHI** reintubated on **PHIDate** . Hemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters . **PHI** did develop worsening metabolic acidosis . His hemodialysis was adjusted in **PHI** effort to resolve this . **PHI** continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , **PHI** , and fluconazole antibiotics . Another effort was made to attempt to wean the intra aortic balloon pump on **PHIDate** . This resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable . **PHI** did have runs of non sustained ventricular tachycardia . On **PHIDate** Mr. **PHI** began developing periods of hypotension . The patient stated that **PHI** did not want to **PHI** reintubated , as it became quite clear that **PHI** would not **PHI** a transplant candidate . **PHI** began having multiple runs of non sustained ventricular tachycardia . The patient and his significant friend , **PHI** , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , **PHI** the futility of his situation , supportive care should **PHI** ended . Indicative of this , Mr. **PHI** took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not **PHI** replaced . **PHI** developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of **PHIDate** . **PHI** R. **PHI** , M.D .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient was a 71 year old **PHI** female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula . The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 . She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe . This **PHI** have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present . Bronchoscopy at that time showed **PHI** endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to **PHI** unresectable . She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in **PHI** through **PHI** of **PHI** . She had been doing reasonably well until **PHI** of **PHI** when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids . A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with **PHI** opening into the trachea above the carina and **PHI** tumor in the right upper lobe . She **PHI** been on total parenteral nutrition and **PHI** been nothing by mouth since then . A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right **PHI** bronchus below the carina . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , **PHI** history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck . **PHI** ON ADMISSION Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , **PHI** Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered **PHI** inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d . , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d . ALLERGIES The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a pleasant **PHI** female in **PHI** acute distress . She is afebrile with stable **PHI** **PHI** . The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable . Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit . The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes . **PHI** sounds are present bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm . The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended . Extremities **PHI** clubbing , cyanosis or edema . The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian . The patient was brought to the Operating Room on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right **PHI** bronchus . Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea . Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy . She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy . The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration . She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit . The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin . On postoperative day two , she had **PHI** electroencephalogram which showed **PHI** evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing . The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology **PHI** for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking . **PHI** endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis . She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet . The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator . A repeat echocardiogram on **PHI** **PHI** showed **PHI** significant change of her previous echocardiogram on **PHI** **PHI** , which showed only a small pericardial effusion . A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on **PHI** **PHI** also showed **PHI** evidence of a focal collection or abscess . She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics . Her **PHI** X ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome . She suffered **PHI** episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity . Her steroids were weaned . Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , she had a tracheostomy placed . She remained in a coma . The blood cultures on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia . Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well . The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed **PHI** evidence of fluid collections . There was a **PHI** left pleural effusion however . This was drained with a left chest tube . Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem . She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , she regained some level of consciousness . She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , her right lung was pleurodesed . Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of **PHI** and Fentanyl . This was tried for approximately seven **PHI** with **PHI** real progress made toward facilitating her **PHI** wean . She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 & apos ; s . She also fell into a coma once again . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation . **PHI** were held with the patient & apos ; s family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to **PHI** maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or **PHI** **PHI** for recovery . She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of **PHI** **PHI** , as well as in discussions with her loved ones . Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. **PHI** to terminate artificial respiratory support . The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics . Her respirations ceased and she died at 10 **PHI** a.m. on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . DISPOSITION PLAN ON **PHI** The family will return the body to Sa for burial .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS **PHI** is **PHI** 82 year old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease ( status post PCI of the RCA one week ago ), history of peripheral vascular disease and preserved LV function with history of nonsustained VT . **PHI** was transferred from **PHI** outside hospital for further investigation and management of his recent arrhythmic problem . **PHI** was noted by the cardiologist to complain of some malaise with **PHI** complaints of weakness and malaise . **PHI** also complained of mild palpitations and syncope . At the time of his visit to his cardiologist & apos ; s office , **PHI** was noted to **PHI** in tachycardia which was found to **PHI** a junctional tachycardia , treated with carotid sinus massage , breaking into sinus bradycardia . In the setting of the sinus bradycardia , **PHI** had a very prolonged PR interval and happened to **PHI** on sotalol which was subsequently discontinued . **PHI** ON ADMISSION Ecotrin ; Lipitor ; Cardura ; Plavix ; Lasix ; Cozaar ; Procardia . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION **PHI** was comfortable , afebrile with a heart rate of 60 beat min and a blood pressure of 100 70 , respirations 18 . JVP was not raised . His cardiac exam revealed a fourth heart sounds , normal S1 , S2 and **PHI** ejection systolic murmur at the base of the heart . His abdominal examination was benign . Lungs were clear . His EKG at the time of presentation showed evidence of sinus bradycardia , prolonged PR interval at 100 500 ms and evidence of Wenckebach . His EKG also showed evidence of atrial echo beats and evidence of a slow AV nodal re entrant tachycardia . IMPRESSION **PHI** is **PHI** 82 year old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease with evidence of intrinsic conduction tissue disease who presented with **PHI** **PHI** . **PHI** was admitted with the idea of having electrophysiology study to determine the exact mechanism of his tachycardia and subsequently undergo radiofrequency ablation . It was also felt that because of his underlying conduction tissue disease , **PHI** would benefit from having a permanent pacemaker implanted . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient had his electrophysiology study on **PHIDate** . His baseline tracings showed evidence of a high AV block with AV Wenckebach at 550 ms . **PHI** had evidence of **PHI** , typical slow fast variant which was easily inducible . Two radiofrequency ablations at the slow pathway terminated the tachycardia . The patient was not inducible for tachycardia at the end of the procedure . The procedure was well tolerated , and **PHI** was transferred back to the step down unit for further monitoring . On the next morning of **PHIDate** , the patient had a dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted . This was a Medtronic Sigma SDR 303 type pacemaker . His atrial and ventricular lead were **PHI** bipolar . The atrial measurements were as follows amplitude 5.6 to 8 mV , outflow threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.4 ms , evidence for lead impedance of 450 ohm . His ventricular measurements were as follows RV amplitude of greater than 15.68 , output threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.5 ms and impedance of 680 ohm . The patient was kept overnight for further monitoring . Noninvasive pacemaker evaluation on **PHIDate** showed optimal sensing and capture thresholds of **PHI** the atrial and ventricular leads . A chest x ray prior to **PHI** showed adequate position of the atrial and ventricular leads . Of note , there was a coincidental finding of a small solitary pulmonary nodule on his **PHI** x ray , and the patient **PHI** been advised regarding obtaining a CAT scan after discharge to follow up on this . After discussions with the patient and his family , they preferred having the CAT scan performed at the hospital closer to their residence so that it could **PHI** sequentially followed up with serial CAT scans if there was a need for the same . The patient will follow up with his cardiologist as well as his primary care physician in the outpatient setting . **PHI** **PHI** also been **PHI** a follow up appointment with the pacemaker clinic . **PHI** **PHI** His **PHI** at the time of discharge essentially remain the same . **PHI** is being discharged on 1 .

These nodules are confirmed by chest CT and demonstrated to **PHI** smaller than 3 millimeter peripheral nodules appearing in **PHI** lung apices . **PHI** CT also demonstrated questionable right hepatic hemangioma and multiple tubular hypodensities were hepatic veins should **PHI** . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT Because of the extensiveness of Ms. **PHI** & apos ; s hospital course it will **PHI** organized by system 1 . Neurological On admission the patient was intubated and sedated . Her sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have **PHI** underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family . A psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on Paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission . On **PHI** **PHI** , Ms. **PHI** again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive . She spent several **PHI** in the Intensive Care Unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off . 2 . Pulmonary Ms. **PHI** was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 . After two weeks of intubation on **PHI** **PHI** the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue . Over the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off . By **PHI** **PHI** she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by **PHI** **PHI** . At this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness . She was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten **PHI** in the Intensive Care Unit . After her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several **PHI** tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . At the time of her discharge , she had **PHI** acute respiratory issues . 3 . Cardiovascular Ms. **PHI** was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of **PHI** Synephrine . She was placed on a Swan **PHI** catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the **PHI** Synephrine by the **PHI** of **PHI** . She required **PHI** further support and had **PHI** further issues until **PHI** **PHI** when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit . At this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at **PHI** of 500 micrograms per minute . A Swan **PHI** catheter floated at this time demonstrated **PHI** SVR of 500 . She was supported with Dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the Dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 **PHI** for full weaning . After the wean she required **PHI** further cardiac medication and had **PHI** further issues . 4 . Renal Ms. **PHI** & apos ; s fluid management was **PHI** important contributor to her hospital course . She presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received **PHI** volume diuresis with regular Lasix dosing daily . Renal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on **PHI** **PHI** . At this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to **PHI** of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at **PHI** of **PHI** to .7 . **PHI** elevation by Dr. **PHI** of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient & apos ; s course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion . Her azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation . At the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values . 5 . Gastrointestinal Ms. **PHI** was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone . She was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would **PHI** a prolonged course without PO intake . On **PHI** **PHI** a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually . These G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re admission to the Intensive Care Unit on **PHI** **PHI** aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held . She was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit . At the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce **PHI** aspirates . This problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital . She is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly . She **PHI** also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d . via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly **PHI** her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse . Ms. **PHI** , from the onset of her stay at **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase **PHI** in isolation from her other liver function tests . These values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the **PHI** end of normal . **PHI** was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was **PHI** evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal . 5 & apos ; nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 . To date there **PHI** been **PHI** satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 & apos ; nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative . Further evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as **PHI** outpatient . 6 . Infectious disease Ms. **PHI** underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course . She ruled out by PPD . The initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin . Because of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection . The course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen **PHI** . At this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several **PHI** . She then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of **PHI** **PHI** . ON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo Vanc Flagyl . Shortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could **PHI** stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone . After a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional **PHI** , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics . On discharge , she was currently taking **PHI** antibiotics . Ms. **PHI** entered the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes . Because of the stress of her infection and Intensive Care Unit admission she was requiring sliding scale Insulin for the full course of her hospital stay . Her total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with Insulin NPH for better control . Her total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units NPH q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars . Ms. **PHI** & apos ; s hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was **PHI** important aspect of her therapy during her course at **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital . Her thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay . At the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on **PHI** **PHI** it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 . More active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and **PHI** improvement in her physiology almost immediately . She **PHI** since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d . However , she **PHI** had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 . Her discharge medication will **PHI** Synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter **PHI** followed closely . IN SUMMARY Ms. **PHI** is a fifty nine year old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection . Over the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound . Her course , however was complicated by **PHI** methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week . Her course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but **PHI** since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy . Currently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several **PHI** before her transfer was initiated . Her wound also requires further care as smaller areas of **PHI** take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .

The patient recently went to **PHI** **PHI** and on a flight back to **PHI** in **PHI** Avenue , **PHI** A , the patient developed increased breathlessness , wanting the airplane to make **PHI** emergency landing at Ton balt airport so that she could get medical assistance . The patient mentions that she had been having a breathing problem for the last two years , which had gradually progressed . The patient had not seen a physician at this time and was not on any **PHI** . The patient personally felt that this was secondary to anxiety , however , during the holiday she had a hectic touring schedule and she felt her shortness of breath was getting gradually worse . Three **PHI** prior to the flight back to Maine , the patient said that she developed a cold with progressive productive cough which got worse in the last three to four **PHI** prior to admission . The patient was not on any medication for the **PHI** and there was **PHI** accompanying fever or hemoptysis . The patient felt excessively dyspneic on the day of her travel , such that she could not walk to the airport and was **PHI** a wheelchair with assistance . On the six hour flight , the patient suddenly felt worsening of her shortness of breath and got up and vomited . She was also incontinent . **PHI** anesthesiologist on board saw her and felt that she was significantly hypotensive and had the plane land emergently at Nebraska . She was subsequently transferred to the **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital . In the emergency room the patient was **PHI** nebulizers . She was placed on I.V . Heparin and **PHI** oxygen three liters with sats remaining somewhere between 85 and 90 %. She was also started on Zithromax .

Electrocardiogram notable for sinus tachycardia with emphysematous pattern , poor R progression V1 through V3 , and P. pulmonale with right axis deviation . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted for acute and chronic respiratory distress with likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and question of a pulmonary embolus . The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial CK & apos ; s which were normal . Echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricle , a dilated right ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis . The RVSP was estimated at 35 . Echocardiogram findings with persistent , profound right heart failure . The patient subsequently underwent a pulmonary arteriogram which revealed **PHI** pulmonary emboli , but pulmonary artery pressure of 39 22 , wedge pressure of 12 and a right atrial pressure of 10 . The patient also had mild liver function test abnormalities , for which she underwent right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed patent portal vein , patent hepatic vein and artery and bilateral small pleural effusions with a 4 cm . complex cystic lesion with calcified walls on the lateral aspect of the spleen . The patient & apos ; s heparin was subsequently discontinued . Pulmonary status stabilized , with the patient & apos ; s room air sat hovering around 90 %. Microbiologic work up for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare exacerbation was subsequently negative . The patient remained cardiovascularly stable but unclear etiology of her subtle electrocardiogram changes and respiratory distress . It was subsequently felt after full work up with a negative PA gram , plus minus VQ , negative echocardiogram , negative sero CK & apos ; s and **PHI** evolving electrocardiogram that the patient had pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease . It was felt that the patient likely had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of greater severity and duration than initially suspected and by history from the patient , in particular supported by her chronic CO2 retention on subsequent arterial blood gases . The patient was maintained on treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , including steroid taper and **PHI** as well as antibiotic coverage . Repeat **PHI** x ray subsequently showed hyperinflation consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , **PHI** **PHI** of pneumonia or pulmonary edema , bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles , consistent with pleural thickening , and or small bilateral pleural effusions , consistent with right upper quadrant ultrasound .

In 1985 she had a routine CABG with two saphenous **PHI** grafts , and a LIMA to the LAD complicated to ARDS and prolonged intubation . She then went for 13 years without significant symptoms . In the fall of 1998 she sustained **PHI** MI and **PHI** echo at that point revealed **PHI** EF of 40 %. In **PHI** , **PHI** , she had another redo CABG with the radial artery to the LAD and saphenous vein graft to the OM . This was complicated by a DVT . In **PHIDate** , she began to have **PHI** pain consistently upon walking . In **PHIDate** , she developed rest angina , which was relieved with nitroglycerin . In **PHIDate** , she had a positive stress test and was put on 5 milligrams of Norvasc which was subsequently increased to 10 milligrams . Since New Years **PHI** , after a family argument she had two hours of chest pain , and was sent to the **PHI** Memorial Hospital Emergency Department . She received enoxaparin but this was complicated by severe ecchymoses over her flank , and therefore the enoxaparin was discontinued . On **PHIDate** , she had a thallium stress test which revealed diffuse subendocardial ischemia with ST depressions in 1 , L , V2 and V3 . She was transferred to the **PHI** Region **PHI** Hospital for a catheterization which revealed **PHI** 80 % ostial left main , 50 % distal left main , 90 % mid left circumflex , 80 % proximal OM , and occluded proximal right coronary artery which was fed by distal collaterals .

She is referred for progressive angina . She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but **PHI** further testing . She **PHI** used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 . In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. **PHI** at **PHI** **PHI** Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded . In **PHI** , **PHI** , Dr. **PHI** re did her bypass operation . She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 . In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block . She had exertional angina at that time . In **PHI** , **PHI** she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to **PHI** Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft . She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis . Since that time she **PHI** continued to have exertional left **PHI** burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin . She was turned down for re do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . Because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here . In **PHI** , **PHI** she had **PHI** exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic . She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect . She **PHI** had **PHI** syncope . Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol . She **PHI** a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction . She is a remote cigarette smoker . She also **PHI** a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages . She **PHI** had a total abdominal hysterectomy . SOCIAL HISTORY She is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from **PHI** She lives alone . Her son , **PHI** is nearby and **PHI** works at the Em **PHI** Medical Center on **PHI** . They live in Ohio . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION She is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds . Her blood pressure was 120 70 , pulse 60 and regular . Neck veins are not distended . Respiratory rate 12 . Carotids **PHI** bruits . Lungs were clear . Cardiac **PHIDate** systolic ejection murmur . Abdomen was benign . Peripheral pulses intact . Neurological examination **PHI** focal . LABORATORY DATA On admission , includes **PHI** electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing . Hematocrit 39 percent , **PHI** blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal . Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , **PHI** 24 , creatinine 1.0 . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory . There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44 17 . Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with **PHI** of the apex . She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction . Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was **PHI** obtuse marginal branch . The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded . The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded . The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with **PHI** significant stenosis , but there was **PHI** outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery . This was considered her culprit lesion . This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft . In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous **PHI** harvested from **PHI** thighs . Her left internal mammary artery was also unused . It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead . She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing . This was intermittent . The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not **PHI** totally sensed . The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker . It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure . Her pacemaker was set to a **PHI** mode which sensed appropriately . She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time . When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina . Carotid **PHI** invasive testing was unremarkable . The situation was reviewed with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** . **PHI** felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a **PHI** anterior myocardial infarction . For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates . The situation was reviewed with Dr. **PHI** of the Pacemaker **PHI** . On **PHI** **PHI** , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could **PHI** adjusted to .15 mm . , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing . There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads . It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode . She tolerated this well . Her **PHI** were resumed .

SOCIAL HISTORY Negative for tobacco , negative for alcohol . The patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends . HOSPITAL COURSE 1 ) Cardiovascular The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction . She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated **PHI** dysrhythmia during this time . The patient underwent **PHI** echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and **PHI** significant valvular abnormalities . The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix . The patient & apos ; s **PHI** was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160 170 systolic in her right arm . The patient also underwent **PHI** Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia . At this time , the patient & apos ; s presyncopal symptoms were not felt to **PHI** secondary to a cardiovascular etiology . 2 ) Neurological vascular The discrepancy in the patient & apos ; s pulses and blood pressure was felt to **PHI** consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis . The **PHI** underwent MRI MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery . The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon . The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA . MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely **PHI** old right cerebellar infarct . The **PHI** underwent **PHI** invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated **PHI** significant carotid disease . The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in **PHI** of her vertebral arteries bilaterally . The results of these studies suggested that the patient & apos ; s symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and or surgical or percutaneous intervention . A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could **PHI** done for the patient & apos ; s intervascular disease would **PHI** adequate control of her blood pressure . 3 ) Orthopedic The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Ms. **PHI** is a 69 year old right handed woman , status post surgical correction of a C 1 to C 2 dural AVM in **PHI** , **PHI** , now presenting with a one month history of increasing left sided weakness and pain with spasticity , occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain . She was originally admitted to the **PHI** Medical Center in **PHI** , **PHI** , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity . She was found to have intermedullary lesion at C1 2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural **PHI** malformation at that level which was surgically corrected . The postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention . She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery . As of the beginning of **PHI** , **PHI** , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ). Functionally , she was at the level of pre gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support . Over the past 4 5 weeks her functional level **PHI** progressively deteriorated . She is now unable to stand and **PHI** assistance to sit up . Her left arm **PHI** developed a flexure contraction and she reports **PHI** pain in the left arm and leg which occurs **PHI** spontaneously and is also triggered by contact . She **PHI** developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she **PHI** lost ten pounds . She denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency . Over the past several weeks she **PHI** also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently . The patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum . This pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Ms. **PHI** is a 73 year old Portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via Med Flight to **PHI** Medical Center . She arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm . She initially presented to **PHI** Medical Center on **PHIDate** complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids . While she was in **PHI** Medical Center , she developed new onset stridor , and **PHI** ENT consult was obtained . They attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway . She was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest . **PHI** these findings , she underwent a CT scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus . This raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to **PHI** Medical Center emergently . At the **PHI** and Ot of **PHI** Medical Center , she underwent **PHI** emergent CT scan with IV contrast . This revealed **PHI** extravasation of contrast and **PHI** aortic aneurysm . However , it did show **PHI** anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma . She was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery **PHI** under the care of Dr. **PHI** . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Severe hypertension , angina , GERD , peptic ulcer disease , status post Billroth II , ovarian cancer , status post TAH BSO in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left **PHI** infection . **PHI** PRIOR TO ADMISSION Celexa 10 mg p.o . q.d . ; Lasix 40 mg p.o . q.d . ; Capoten 50 mg p.o . b.i.d . ; Pepcid 20 mg p.o . q.d . ; Cardizem 180 mg p.o . q.d . ; Xanax 0.5 mg tabs . On transfer , she was on her preadmission **PHI** plus **PHI** and Tigan 250 mg p.o . q.6h . p.r.n . ALLERGIES **PHI** known drug allergies . SOCIAL HISTORY She is divorced and retired . She lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is intubated . **PHI** **PHI** Temperature 98.6 , 66 . Right arm was 180 80 , left 188 72 , and A line was 151 61 . Tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of PEEP , and 100 % FiO2 , satting 100 %. **PHI** She was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities . NECK Edematous . Trachea was midline . She had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck . The superior clavicular area showed **PHI** **PHI** of central line access attempts . She had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region . Her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis . LUNGS She had bilateral expiratory wheezes . ABDOMEN Soft with good bowel sounds . It was nontender . It was obese with a **PHI** midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant . **PHI** were easily reducible . PULSE On the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial . LABORATORY DATA CBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 . Coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 . Her gas was 7.47 40 332 . Electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 . EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block . CT scan showed **PHI** anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air . It was consistent with a hematoma . HOSPITAL COURSE Ms. **PHI** underwent **PHI** EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on **PHIDate** shortly after she arrived . This showed tracheal compressions but **PHI** other lesions that were obvious at the time . She was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator . The differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. **PHI** abscess vs. a thyroid tumor . On **PHIDate** , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy . A biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma . The operative report shows that there was **PHI** abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot . There was **PHI** active bleeding at the time . Over the next several **PHI** , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator . She had **PHI** elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could **PHI** a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma . The ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level . **PHI** these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan . The Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid . At this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma . **PHI**. **PHI** brought the patient to the operating room on **PHIDate** . She underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy . She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well . Her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left . This required a chest tube . Her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of **PHI** despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and **PHI** obvious source of bleeding . It was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest . However , we are not quite sure why this was occurring . She underwent **PHI** extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology . It turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology . In conclusion , by systems 1 . Neuro . The patient became intermittently agitated . We have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n . throughout the day . She responds well to this . She speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks . She **PHI** a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day . She **PHI** been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. **PHI** is in good spirits . 2 . Cardiac . The patient & apos ; s blood pressure **PHI** been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic . This is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d . as well as **PHI** 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d . , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d . She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated . For this , we have **PHI** her 10 mg of hydralazine . Her blood pressure responds well to this . Otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and **PHI** been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization . The patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter . This **PHI** been followed by the Vascular Surgery **PHI** here at the **PHI** and Ot of **PHI** Medical Center . Dr. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** been consulted . The aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm . They elected not to inject it with thrombin . They asked that the patient follow up with **PHI**. **PHI** in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can **PHI** assessed . They have opted for conservative management **PHI** the size . 3 . Respiratory . At the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 . She seems to **PHI** tolerating this well as she **PHI** **PHI** O2 sat of 100 % on 40 % FIO2 . Her **PHI** x ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few **PHI** . Her right lung field is clear . Her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had **PHI** problems with it . She will obviously need to **PHI** weaned as tolerated . We had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week . With the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to **PHI** brought back up to 10 . Her oxygen saturation **PHI** always been good . 4 . GI . The patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour . This is her goal . She tolerates them very well and **PHI** approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day . Last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day . Stool cultures have been sent numerous **PHI** as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin . These have all been negative . We believe the this was **PHI** osmotic diarrhea . Since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea **PHI** resolved . She **PHI** been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range . 5 . GU . The patient **PHI** had hypernatremia . She is approximately 10 kg up her **PHI** body weight . We believe her to still **PHI** total body overloaded . Over the last several **PHI** , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube . We also have been diuresing her with Bumex . This seems to trend her sodium down . This will need to **PHI** monitored closely . Her **PHI** and creatinine have been normal , and she **PHI** always made good urine . 6 . Heme . As stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation . She had **PHI** extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin . Before we removed her **PHI** tube , we had to give her platelets . She had **PHI** problems with this . At the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range . I stress that she can not **PHI** anticoagulated . We have **PHI** her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed . Therefore , she is on **PHI** DVT prophylaxis . She does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis . She **PHI** a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis . 7 . ID . At the time of discharge , the patient **PHI** a urinary tract infection . She is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures . Interestingly enough , she also **PHI** Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum . This is also sensitive only to Macrodantin . We do not believe that she **PHI** any respiratory process going on at the time . She is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d . for a ten day course . Her Foley was changed the day before discharge . 8 .

LIST OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS ( 1 ) High risk carcinoma of the right breast . ( 2 ) Hypertension . ( 3 ) Hypothyroidism . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Ms. A is a 48 year old woman , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in **PHI** of **PHI** . She was in her usual state of health until **PHI** of **PHI** , when her right breast was noted to **PHI** abnormal on mammography . Biopsy of this specific area was negative . Subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change . However , by **PHI** **PHI** , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time . Mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy . **PHI** ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm . The patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma . She , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( **PHI** **PHI** ). The final results from pathology revealed a very **PHI** tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin . The tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion . ER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K 617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase . DNA content was deployed . On examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma . Subsequent to surgery , she had **PHI** uncomplicated recovery . She then went on to **PHI** intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well . Restaging revealed **PHI** evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high **PHI** cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization . **PHI** went well and stem cell yields were excellent . Therefore , she is being admitted for intensification with high dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin followed by stem cell rescue .

In the **PHI** of 1998 **PHI** was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ cell transformation . In early 1999 **PHI** underwent resection of this mass however in **PHI** of **PHI** **PHI** was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles . In **PHIDate** **PHI** had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis . In early 2000 **PHI** was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. **PHI** **PHI** and finished this in **PHI** of this year . CT imaging at that time was negative for disease . In **PHI** of this year , **PHI** was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side . Thereafter **PHI** began chemotherapy with Taxotere in **PHIDate** and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on **PHIDate** . Most recently **PHI** **PHI** had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the **PHI** Region **PHI** Hospital on **PHIDate** . That hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a **PHI** left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus . **PHI** was treated with intra arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on **PHIDate** on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin . It was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization . Finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to **PHI** resuscitated in the event of a life threatening situation .

ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES **PHIDate** sternal debridement . Bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap . Right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap . Primary closure of wound . HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION The patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of **PHI** ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection . At that time the patient & apos ; s hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap . The patient was then continued by report on Dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation . The patient apparently did well until **PHI** **PHI** when **PHI** noted a bulge in his sternal area . A ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired . The patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired . However the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at **PHI** outside hospital showed **PHI** anterior hematoma . By report the patient was at that time told that there was **PHI** more that could **PHI** done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and **PHI** control at the outside hospital . However the patient was then subsequently transferred to **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital upon request of the family on **PHIDate** for further evaluation and possible intervention . The patient was evaluated by Dr. **PHI** of **PHI** . Medical Center . As the patient & apos ; s early evaluation the patient underwent **PHI** aortogram which showed **PHI** ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels . There was **PHI** evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with **PHI** infectious process . At the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease **PHI** who upon culturing the patient & apos ; s sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous **PHI** to Levofloxacin for what appeared to **PHI** Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures . Subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient & apos ; s wound drainage appeared to subside . **PHI** all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient & apos ; s only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure . The patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed . The **PHI** otherwise complained of **PHI** angina , **PHI** shortness of breath , **PHI** paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , **PHI** edema , **PHI** palpitations or symptoms of syncope . **PHI** did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1 . Thoracic aneurysm repair . 2 . Hypertension . 3 . **PHI** post hernia repair . **PHI** ON ADMISSION 1 . Lopressor 100 mg po three **PHI** a day . 2 .

There was **PHI** jugular venous distention . 2+ carotids without bruits . Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm with a **PHIDate** diastolic and a **PHIDate** systolic ejection murmur . His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles . Extremities the patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses . LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA Sodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine **PHI** , **PHI** blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 . The patient & apos ; s preoperative chest x ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient & apos ; s sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical **PHI** under Dr. **PHI** . The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit **PHI** the patient & apos ; s precarious condition . Over the next several hospital **PHI** the **PHI** underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier . The patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease **PHI** as well as the Cardiology **PHI** who assisted in managing the patient & apos ; s intermittent hypertension . The patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical **PHI** for potential sternal reconstruction . After lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient & apos ; s family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft . This was obtained on **PHIDate** by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** of the Cardiac Surgical **PHI** . The patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on **PHIDate** with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection . The procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and **PHI** open chest . The aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein . The cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes . The graft used was a homograft . The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open . The immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient & apos ; s sternum . The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition . There **PHI** continued to **PHI** hemodynamically stable . Of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent . In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until **PHIDate** which was postoperative day **PHI** . 1 following the homograft replacement . On that day the Plastic Surgical **PHI** performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient & apos ; s sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound . The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were **PHI** complications . A number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps . The patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition . At this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease **PHI** and continued to **PHI** on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin . The Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for **PHI** with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters . Over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties . The patient & apos ; s subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three **PHI** a day , Captopril 100 mg po three **PHI** a day , as well as Procardia . The patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control . Subsequently on postoperative day **PHI** . 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to **PHI** ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient **PHI** . The patient continued to **PHI** followed by the Infectious Disease **PHI** who felt that the patient & apos ; s **PHI** **PHI** drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them . As per the Infectious Disease **PHI** the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage . However on **PHIDate** the Infectious Disease **PHI** was made aware that the patient & apos ; s intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma **PHI** . **PHI** this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to **PHI** at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well . The patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that **PHI** was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics . This was placed on postoperative day **PHI** . 9 without any difficulty . At the same time the patient continued to **PHI** stable on his antihypertensive regimen . **PHI** was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which **PHI** tolerated well . **PHI** continued to **PHI** afebrile and otherwise very stable . On postoperative day **PHI** . 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger . Subsequent hand x rays obtained showed **PHI** evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand **PHI** . The patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint . The patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical **PHI** who discontinued a number of the patient & apos ; s indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation . These drains will then **PHI** subsequently taken out by Dr. **PHI** upon his followup with the patient . Prior to **PHI** the patient also underwent **PHI** audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics . The patient otherwise continued to **PHI** hemodynamically stable making good progress . As a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress **PHI** the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation . The patient & apos ; s condition continued to **PHI** improved . **PHI** this finding the patient was therefore felt to **PHI** ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on **PHIDate** . In consultation with the Infectious Disease **PHI** the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics . CONDITION ON **PHI** Good . **PHI** INSTRUCTIONS Diet High calorie , high protein . The patient & apos ; s treatment will **PHI** typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks . The patient prior to **PHI** was fitted with **PHI** orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital . The patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger . The patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough **PHI** while **PHI** continues on long term Vancomycin therapy . The patient was instructed to return to **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital if **PHI** developed any **PHI** of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain . The patient was instructed to **PHI** vigilant for any fevers or chills . **PHI** ON **PHI** 1 . Vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h . 2 . Levofloxacin 500 mg po per day . 3 . Prilosec 20 mg po per day . 4 . Captopril 100 mg po three **PHI** a day . 5 . Lopressor 100 mg po three **PHI** a day . 6 . Albuterol nebulizers q6h as needed . 7 . Atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed . 8 . Lasix 20 mg po per day . 9 . **PHI** **PHI** 20 mEq po per day . FOLLOWUP The patient was instructed that **PHI** needed to followup with Dr. **PHI** by calling his office for appointment at **PHI** subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in **PHI** **PHI** . The patient was also instructed to followup with **PHI**. **PHI** of the Cardiology **PHI** **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital following his discharge so that his **PHI** **PHI** could **PHI** appropriately adjusted . The patient will also **PHI** seen in followup by Dr. **PHI** E. **PHI** **PHI** of the Plastic Surgery **PHI** **PHI** of **PHI** Hospital so that his indwelling **PHI** **PHI** drains **PHI** appropriately management and if needed **PHI** discontinued by him . The patient will also **PHI** followed by the Infectious Disease **PHI** so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy . The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** of the Infectious Disease **PHI** by calling her office for **PHI** appointment at **PHI** to **PHI** seen in approximately four weeks following the patient & apos ; s discharge . Dr. **PHI** & apos ; s recommendation is that the patient is to stay on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression . **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . **PHI** FOR **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 63 year old woman transferred from Pre Health on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** to the **PHI** Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung . She was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to **PHI** and then transferred to A Hospital . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , the patient desaturated to 40 % with a temperature of 100.5 degrees . Her oxygen saturations improved to only 92 % on 100 % face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit . **PHI** x ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion . A VQ scan was high probability , but **PHI** pulmonary angiogram was done and **PHI** echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with **PHI** wall motion abnormality and **PHI** ejection fraction of 75 %. On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , the patient had a CT scan of the **PHI** which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions . At this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1 640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative . She was started on a steroid trial at that point . Her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia like reaction and a chest tube was placed . The patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day . From **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** through **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , she was transferred to the **PHI** Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1 ) Cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension . 2 ) Hypertension . 3 ) **PHI** post hysterectomy . 4 ) **PHI** post appendectomy . **PHI** ON TRANSFER 1 ) Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d . 2 ) Lasix p.r.n . 3 ) Prednisone 40 mg p.o . q. day . 4 ) Inderal 40 mg p.o . q.i.d . 5 ) Thiamine . 6 ) Lasix p.r.n . 7 ) Atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d . 8 ) Folic acid . 9 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o . q. day . 10 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o . q. day . 11 ) Insulin sliding scale . ALLERGIES The patient had **PHI** known drug allergies . SOCIAL HISTORY The patient is divorced . She **PHI** two children . She recently retired as a clerical worker . She denies any tobacco . She **PHI** only social alcohol use . FAMILY HISTORY Father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease . Mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma . Brother **PHI** coronary artery disease . There is **PHI** family history of hematologic problems . LABORATORY Laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , **PHI** 111 , creatinine 3.9 , **PHI** blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 . HOSPITAL COURSE 1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay . This was changed to **PHI** Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below . By discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day **PHI** one month to **PHI** followed by a slow taper . The patient & apos ; s bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , after starting dialysis ( see below ), the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen . Repeat **PHI** x rays and **PHI** CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload **PHI** her renal failure and eventually , the patient & apos ; s pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks . At the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90 %. 2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear . This was felt to **PHI** consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . She was also changed to intravenous **PHI** Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to **PHI** . Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of **PHI** on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , then they steadily fell to a low of **PHI** on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated . She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased . The patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten **PHI** to maintain her hematocrit . Eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller **PHI** each day and then discontinued altogether after **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . After this , the patient & apos ; s platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge . It is felt that the patient & apos ; s thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura **PHI** resolved . She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper . 3 ) Renal The patient presented in acute renal failure with a **PHI** of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 . Throughout the month of **PHI** , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and **PHI** reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three **PHI** per week . She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload . During the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation . 4 ) Infectious disease The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag . negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** and **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . The patient eventually had a left subclavian **PHI** catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** which remained patent and uninfected . She received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime . In addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin **PHI** fourteen **PHI** . She also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus . She was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty **PHI** . The patient was also started on **PHI** one double strength tablet q.o.d . as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high **PHI** steroids . 5 ) Rheumatology The patient was admitted with a question of lupus **PHI** her ANA of 1 640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative . Unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was **PHI** daily plasma exchange . A repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA **PHI** **PHI** repeated as **PHI** outpatient . FOLLOW UP 1 ) The patient will follow up with her primary care physician , Dr. **PHI** **PHI** , in **PHI** after she is discharged from rehabilitation . 2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three **PHI** per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday . The nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. **PHI** . 3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem 7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will **PHI** faxed to Dr. **PHI** **PHI** , the hematology attending at fax number **PHI** . 4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula . The left subclavian **PHI** which she **PHI** in place will last for several months in the mean time . She would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should **PHI** contacted regarding this . 5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 . 6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o . q. day **PHI** one month ( this was started on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary . 7 ) The patient **PHI** a follow up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** at **PHI** on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** at 1 40 PM . 8 ) The patient **PHI** a follow up appointment with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** at the We **PHI** Hospital at **PHI** on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** at 12 30 PM . **PHI** ON **PHI** 1 ) Calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o . q. day . 2 ) TUMS 1250 mg p.o . t.i.d . 3 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o . q. day . 4 ) Colace 100 mg p.o . b.i.d . 5 ) Humulin sliding scale **PHI** . and q.h.s . 6 ) Labetalol 400 mg p.o . t.i.d . 7 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o . q. day . 8 ) Serax 15 mg p.o . q.h.s . p.r.n . insomnia . 9 ) Prednisone 40 mg p.o . q. day **PHI** thirty **PHI** beginning on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** to **PHI** followed by a slow taper as directed by the pulmonologist . 10 ) Metamucil one packet p.o . q. day . 11 ) Amlodipine 10 mg p.o . q. day . 12 ) **PHI** Double **PHI** one tablet p.o . q.o.d . 13 ) Nephrocaps one tablet p.o . q. day . 14 ) Epogen 1,000 units subcutaneously three **PHI** per week . 15 ) **PHI** sulfate 300 mg p.o . t.i.d .

LABORATORY DATA AND RADIOLOGIC DATA During hospitalization computerized tomography scan examination of brain performed with and without intravenous contrast enhancement was obtained , following demonstration of left partial homonymous hemianopsia . Computerized tomography scan demonstrated two murally enhancing cystic masses , the first occupying much of the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere , the second shown focally in the left lateral occipital lobe , with associated vasogenic edema . Metastatic disease suspected . Additional magnetic resonance angiogram examination requested . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT The patient was admitted on **PHIDate** , at which time intentional balloon sacrifice of right coronary artery was performed . Systemic anticoagulation was accomplished with limited mobility permitted . Over the course of the next three **PHI** the patient was mobilized . At this time the diagnosis of presumed metastatic involvement of a super tentorial and infratentorial compartments had been arrived at , and it was also noted that the patient & apos ; s swallowing was sufficiently impaired where Nutrition was compromised and in question . It was decided at this point that the patient & apos ; s neck resection **PHI** need to **PHI** withheld pending exploration of chemotherapeutic and radiation therapy options , and that the Nutrition status would need to **PHI** addressed . As such , it was decided that a transfer to the **PHI** Community Memorial Hospital under Dr. **PHI** & apos ; care , who is the patient & apos ; s Oncologic Otolaryngologic Surgeon , should **PHI** entertained . On the evening of **PHIDate** , nursing noticed that the patient was somewhat confused , and suspected a possible post ictal state .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. **PHI** is a 58 year old gentleman with a history of anal squamous cell carcinoma , who is admitted with a history of fevers . The patient was initially diagnosed in **PHIDate** with a 6 cm rectal mass . Biopsy , at that time , showed squamous cell carcinoma . A staging CT , at that time , showed **PHI** evidence of inguinal lymph node . The patient was treated with 5 FU , mitomycin , as well as XRT with complete remission . However , in **PHIDate** , the patient was noted to have recurrent anal mass with inguinal lymphadenopathy . **PHI** inguinal biopsy , at that time , showed a squamous cell carcinoma . The patient was treated with cisplatin and taxol **PHI** cycles , which was completed in **PHIDate** . The patient was noted to have partial response to this . On **PHIDate** , the patient underwent **PHI** abdominoperineal resection and a reconstruction rectus flap . His hospital course was complicated by postoperative fevers , which were treated with Keflex . However , since that time , the patient **PHI** had persistent multiple perineal non wound healing with drainage . The patient initially presented on **PHIDate** , with a three week history of fevers off of antibiotics . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Metastatic anal squamous cell carcinoma as above ; status post abdominoperineal resection ; status post pilonidal cyst removal . ALLERGIES **PHI** known drug allergies . **PHI** Tylenol p.r.n . ; Darvocet p.r.n . FAMILY HISTORY Positive for father with lung carcinoma . SOCIAL HISTORY The patient smoked 1 2 packs per day x13 years . **PHI** quit in 1988 . **PHI** denies alcohol use . The patient is married . **PHI** lives in **PHI** **PHI** with his wife . They have one daughter and two grandchildren . The patient is formerly a self employed gift shop owner . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION **PHI** **PHI** Temp 97.3 , pulse 84 , BP 130 70 , respiratory rate 16 , SPO2 93 % on room air . **PHI** Regular rate , **PHI** murmur , rubs , or gallops . LUNGS Decreased breath sounds on the right , clear on the left with crackles at the apices . ABDOMEN **PHI** tender , positive bowel sounds , with several well healed scars . A colostomy bag was intact . Perineal exam was significant for surgical wounds x3 , with granulation tissue . **PHI** obvious purulent material or abscesses were noted . NEURO The patient was alert and oriented x3 . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was initially admitted to the Surgery **PHI** with a history of fevers . During his hospital course on the surgery service , **PHI** remained febrile . **PHI** was initially treated with Ancef . **PHI** Infectious Disease consult was obtained and antibiotics were discontinued . The patient remained febrile off of antibiotics and was noted to have **PHI** elevated **PHI** blood cell count . A chest x ray obtained on **PHIDate** revealed a right upper lobe infiltrate and cefotaxime and Flagyl were started for a probable post obstructive pneumonia . On **PHIDate** , a repeat chest CT was obtained , which showed a very **PHI** right hilar mass with multiple pulmonary nodules . CT , Surgery , and Pulmonary consults were obtained regarding further diagnostic evaluations . In addition , the patient was also noted to **PHI** hypercalcemic and was treated with IV fluids and pamidronate . The patient was subsequently transferred from the Surgery **PHI** to the Oncology D **PHI** for further management on **PHIDate** . Briefly , his hospital course by systems on the Oncology D **PHI** ( 1 ) INFECTIOUS DISEASE The patient was continued on cefotaxime and Flagyl for a probable post obstructive pneumonia . Per consult with the pulmonologist , it was not felt that the patient would likely benefit from any sort of procedure or stenting . The decision was made to continue the patient on chronic antibiotic therapy . The patient was discharged on IV ceftriaxone , as well as oral Flagyl with plan to continue IV ceftriaxone for one week and then switch to p.o . Augmentin . In addition , the patient & apos ; s surgical wounds were cultured to R O any evidence of a wound infection . Wound cultures from his buttock region revealed 1+ Acinetobacter , as well as 2+ diphtheroids with rare enterococci . A perirectal culture showed normal fecal flora , and a second wound culture also revealed diphtheroids and coagulase negative Staphylococcus . These were thought to **PHI** contaminants , and the patient was not treated for wound infection . ( 2 ) PULMONARY On **PHIDate** , the patient was noted to have markedly increased O2 requirements , with O2 sats noted in the low 80 % on room air . This increased to 90 93 % on four liters nasal cannula . The patient was noted to have increased wheezes on pulmonary exam . A STAT portable chest x ray revealed markedly increased opacification in the right hemithorax , with increased markings on the left , which was consistent with pulmonary edema . **PHI** EKG was obtained , at that time , which showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 125 , with normal axis and **PHI** acute ST changes noted . The patient was **PHI** IV Lasix with improvement in his O2 saturations . It was also thought , at that time , **PHI** the patient & apos ; s immobility that a pulmonary embolus was also a likely cause of the patient & apos ; s hypoxia . However , at that time , the decision had been made to make the patient DNR **PHI** , and it was not felt that **PHI** aggressive workup for pulmonary embolus was indicated at that time . Throughout the remainder of the patient & apos ; s hospitalization , his respiratory status was stable . ( 3 ) METASTATIC ANAL CARCINOMA CODE **PHI** **PHI** the advanced nature of the patient & apos ; s disease and his failure to respond to chemotherapeutic measures , upon discussion with the patient , the patient & apos ; s wife , and the treatment team , the decision was made to pursue comfort measures , and the patient was made DNR **PHI** . It was felt that aggressive workup was not indicated at that time . The goal of the patient & apos ; s treatment was for maximum comfort and pain control . ( 4 ) HYPERCALCEMIA The patient had been noted to **PHI** hypercalcemic with a calcium of 13.3 . **PHI** was treated with aggressive IV fluid hydration , as well as pamidronate with normalization of his calcium level . **PHI** INSTRUCTIONS The patient was discharged on one week of IV ceftriaxone with p.o . Flagyl , with a plan to change IV ceftriaxone to p.o . Augmentin after one week . In addition , the patient was to receive dressing changes via **PHI** . The plan was for the patient to remain at home until **PHI** and his wife felt that hospice care would **PHI** necessary , at which time , they would transition to **PHI** inpatient hospice unit . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** C 500 mg p.o . b.i.d . ; Colace 100 mg p.o . b.i.d . ; Motrin 600 mg p.o . q.6h . p.r.n . ; Indocin 25 mg p.o . b.i.d .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 69 year old woman from Maine without prior history of overt cardiac disease . She does have a history of peripheral edema on Dyazide . She **PHI** been a smoker and presented on the day of admission with dizziness . She was in her usual state of health until two to three **PHI** prior to admission when she noted intermittent dizziness and felt weak . She denied chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting . On the morning of admission to the **PHI** Memorial Hospital she went out to feed some birds and then felt weak , came back , was dizzy and was somewhat diaphoretic . Her sister with whom she lives insisted that she seek medical care and she was brought to the **PHI** Memorial Hospital emergency room and was found to have a pulse of 61 and blood pressure of 91 45 . The electrocardiogram done there showed evidence of **PHI** inferior wall infarction with ST segment elevations in leads 2 , 3 and AVF and ST depressions in leads V1 through V4 and AVL . Right sided leads did not provide evidence of a right ventricular infarction . She was **PHI** Streptokinase , aspirin , Dopamine for hypotension and Atropine with external **PHI** pacemaker after bradycardia into the 30 & apos ; s developed . The blood sugar was elevated at 208 . The **PHI** was 24 and creatinine 1.7 . The uric acid 11.2 and initial CK was 35 . When she developed wide complex tachycardia she was **PHI** a Lidocaine bolus and brought to the **PHI** by helicopter . In the emergency room she appeared hemodynamically stable initially and the Dopamine was weaned off . The electrocardiogram taken here showed the ST segment elevations had diminished considerably but there were continued reciprocal changes in the anterior leads . She had a few beats of wide complex tachycardia . Her only medication was Dyazide . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION She was a pleasant rather vague obese woman in **PHI** acute distress . The pulse was 68 to 80 and the blood pressure 95 52 . The respirations 18 and she was afebrile . The jugular veins were not distended . The carotids were full . There were **PHI** bruits . The chest was clear with distant breath sounds . The cardiac rhythm was regular with frequent premature beats and **PHI** murmur . There were **PHI** rubs . The abdomen was obese without palpable organs or masses . There was **PHI** peripheral edema . There were good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally . There was decreased vibratory sense on neurological examination but there was **PHI** asterixis . Her electrolytes were normal with a **PHI** of 24 and creatinine 1.9 . The cholesterol was 171 . Triglycerides 103 . By this time her CK was 600 . Her hematocrit was 37.1 . Hemoglobin 12.8 and **PHI** blood count 7800 . The PT was 19.3 and PTT 34.8 . Review of the electrocardiograms from **PHI** Memorial Hospital demonstrated atrial flutter with variable conduction . She was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued ST segment elevation with Qs in 3 and AVF . She was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of **PHI** ventricular tachycardia . She became increasingly disoriented . She developed first degree AV block and then Wenckebach block . The **PHI** films showed mild cephalization . She became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation . She went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock . She had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 . Catheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with **PHI** significant left sided disease . The right coronary artery had a **PHI** burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result . She had TIMI 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery . She continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia . She remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat . Dobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation . She was initially tried on intravenous Pronestyl in **PHI** attempt to restore sinus rhythm . She was later switched to Amiodarone but there continued to **PHI** **PHI** effect on her atrial fibrillation . Eventually her lines were able to **PHI** withdrawn and she was moved to the floor . She had a lot of wheezing and in late **PHI** she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure . She was then returned to the Unit where she underwent further monitoring . The **PHI** rose to 91 . Her Digoxin level was **PHI** on **PHI** **PHI** . She was able eventually to **PHI** extubated and moved back to the floor . **PHI** to mobilize her began in early **PHI** and **PHI** echocardiogram demonstrated **PHI** ejection fraction of 49 %. The right ventricular function was normal . After extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with Decadron . The patient was seen in consultation by ENT consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis . There was **PHI** structural abnormality . Moistened oxygen and Mucomyst was **PHI** with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor . She continued a rather slow improvement . The patient was seen in consultation by Drs . **PHI** and **PHI** because of the abnormalities of renal function . The possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a MRI . She had some hematuria and was seen by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** . Renal and bladder ultrasounds were normal . She had abnormal urinary cytology however and Dr. **PHI** strongly recommended that this **PHI** followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that . That can take place either here at his office or in **PHI** **PHI** Sun or when she returns to **PHI** Hospital . Because of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head CT scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding . This was followed up and was shown to resolve . MR angiogram revealed **PHI** evidence of renal artery stenosis . A MRI of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous . She was then begun on Coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on **PHI** Hospital . **PHI** R.

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE Wide resection of metastatic melanoma to the right shoulder with partial thickness skin graft reconstruction on **PHIDate** . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS This is a 69 year old man who was initially diagnosed with a right upper posterior extremity melanoma level 4 , 2.5 mm in depth , in **PHIDate** . Subsequently in **PHIDate** **PHI** underwent a wide excision with axillary dissection which showed residual malignant melanoma with nine negative lymph nodes . **PHI** had a recurrence in **PHIDate** in a similar area which was 2.1 mm in thickness . **PHI** had this resected between **PHIDate** and **PHIDate** and was treated with 6000 C of radiation therapy over the right upper extremity . **PHI** **PHI** done well since that time and subsequently in **PHIDate** had pulmonary nodules which were noted and a computer tomogram scan in **PHIDate** demonstrated a 4.2 cm splenic lesion . **PHI** underwent **PHI** open splenectomy in the Fall 1998 which demonstrated metastatic melanoma only to the spleen . Since that time **PHI** **PHI** been treated with cells in 1999 and also with **PHI** injection to the right anterior axillary nodule . Most recently in **PHI** **PHI** this right anterior axillary metastatic melanoma resected at Brook Hospital by Dr. **PHI** on with local triceps myocutaneous tissue transfer . Since **PHI** through **PHI** this area **PHI** increased in size where the triceps tissue transfer **PHI** been replaced with a bulky metastatic melanoma disease . Surgical consultation for resection of this for local control was requested . The patient **PHI** Dr. **PHI** and **PHI** known visceral metastases of the liver as well the lung with mediastinal adenopathy which **PHI** been stable for the past two years . The other complicating factor in his care was that **PHI** was wheelchair bound from a viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1966 and **PHI** relied heavily on his upper extremity for wheelchair transfer and access and transportation . In order to workup up this metastatic melanoma recurrent after local excision only two months previously it was elected to get **PHI** magnetic resonance imaging scan of the shoulder . This magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed that there was a **PHI** mass which measured approximately 4 6cm anterior to the deltopectoral groove and unfortunately a smaller lesion 1cm was seen separately adjacent and medial to the biceps tendon near the brachial neurovascular bundle . **PHI** magnetic resonance imaging scan which was performed three months prior to admission to Brook Hospital for resection demonstrated that this more medial lesion was not present at that time and therefore it was suspicious for metastatic melanoma . The patient had a fine needle aspiration of this bulky tumor mass which demonstrated malignant melanoma and subsequently **PHI** was sent for a positron emission tomography scan which was performed at S **PHI** University Hospital And Medical Center on **PHIDate** . The positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a known larger anterior metastatic melanoma and more medially two approximately 1cm lesions that also enhanced . These were consistent with metastatic melanoma near the brachial plexus confirmed by the magnetic resonance imaging scan . The patient now presents for surgical resection and reconstructive repair of this lesion . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1996 which left him paralyzed from waist down and wheelchair bound . **PHI** is incontinent of bowel and bladder and wears a Texas catheter due to phimosis of the penis . **PHI** also suffered comminuted fractures of the right lower extremity . **PHI** **PHI** bilateral venous stasis and hypertension .

Her name is Dr. **PHI** **PHI** . FAMILY HISTORY Father with renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer . Mother with primary brain tumor . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Afebrile , **PHI** **PHI** stable . His right shoulder had a **PHI** 6cm bulky mass which had grown somewhat in size over the past 2 3 weeks . The bulky mass is somewhat mobile on the medial aspect and there are subcutaneous nodules which had not been present before . The axillary area medially **PHI** two dominant nodules . HOSPITAL COURSE The **PHI** underwent a wide excision of the malignant melanoma of his right shoulder and partial thickness skin grafting to his right axilla . The donor site was his right thigh . **PHI** tolerated the procedure well and there were **PHI** complications . A Vac dressing was applied postoperatively and this was maintained for four **PHI** . When this was taken down the graft was noted to **PHI** healthy with good take . It was then dressed with Adaptic and Bacitracin ointment and covered with a dry sterile dressing per day . The harvest site was blown dry with a blow dryer . The patients pain was controlled initially with a PCA and this was eventually discontinued and **PHI** was started on Oxycontin . His Foley was discontinued and a Texas catheter was reapplied . **PHI** was tolerating a regular diet with regular bowel movements with digital rectal stimulation . **PHI** began to work with OT **PHI** . They began range of motion to his right upper extremity except for around his shoulder . This was kept to minimal activity . **PHI** remained afebrile with stable **PHI** **PHI** . On discharge his graft is clean , dry and intact without any evidence of discharge or erythema . His donor site is also without evidence of infection . CONDITION ON **PHI** Good . **PHI** INSTRUCTIONS Regarding the patient & apos ; s physical activity status **PHI** is to **PHI** minimally weight **PHI** of the right upper extremity . There is to **PHI** **PHI** range of motion to the right shoulder but active range of motion to the rest of his right upper extremity . **PHI** is not to transfer to a wheelchair using his upper arm .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION In the emergency room , his pulse was 120 , blood pressure initially was in the 90 & apos ; s , core temperature was 96.5 .. **PHI** , neurologically , was unresponsive and intubated . **PHI** had received **PHI** [] and Fentanyl for sedation in route to the hospital . head , eyes , ears , nose and throat revealed some superficial facial abrasions . His trachea was midline . **PHI** had a C collar in place . His **PHI** wall appeared stable without any crepitus . **PHI** had equal breath sounds on **PHI** sides . His abdomen was flat , scaphoid , and did not appear distended . **PHI** did have some bruising along his anterior abdominal wall as well as a superficial abrasion . His pelvis was stable upon **PHI** AP and Lateral compression . His examination of his right lower extremity revealed a deformity at his distal thigh . **PHI** had **PHI** open laceration over what appeared to **PHI** a tib fib fracture over his leg . **PHI** had obvious fractures in his left hand . His back exam revealed **PHI** stepoff or evidence of spine injury . His labs were significant for a prothrombin time of 25 , hematocrit of 30 , other labs were unremarkable . His trauma series revealed a left sided pulmonary contusion and a wide mediastinum . Evaluation of the C spine revealed a C5 fracture . His pelvis film was normal . **PHI** had films of his right femur which revealed a distal femur fracture as well as a right sided fibular fracture . **PHI** underwent a head computerized tomography scan which was negative followed by **PHI** abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan which revealed a left sided pulmonary contusion . A small , left sided pneumothorax . His abdominal computerized tomography scan revealed a **PHI** liver laceration as well as a splenic laceration . Throughout his stay in the emergency room , his blood pressure was above 90 . **PHI** was tachycardic to 120 . Because of a persistent volume requirement , **PHI** was taken up to the operating room for exploration . In route to the operating room , the patient lost his pulse . cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated . **PHI** then underwent a resuscitative left thoracotomy and crossclamping of his aorta . Details of this operation are dictated in a separate note . We were able to obtain a pulse upon crossclamping of his aorta . We then performed **PHI** abdominal exploration which revealed a **PHI** left lobe of liver laceration down to his inferior vena cava . This was actively bleeding which could not **PHI** controlled . The patient once again lost his pulse and we were unable to come off the aortic crossclamp . Because of this massive liver injury , this **PHI** liver laceration could not **PHI** repaired and **PHI** was pronounced at 10 **PHI** AM on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS This 75 year old male had been noted to **PHI** anemic with **PHI** abnormal **PHI** blood count since at least **PHI** **PHI** , while **PHI** was living in **PHI** **PHI** Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low **PHI** hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . **PHI** came to this country in late **PHI** **PHI** to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . **PHI** had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . **PHI** became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on **PHIDate** with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with **PHI** Italian variation of Digoxin , and **PHI** , hypertension managed with **PHI** **PHI** inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a **PHI** preparation and low dose steroids , as well as **PHI** occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which **PHI** had been advised not to drink any alcohol . **PHI** also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION **PHI** was a chronically **PHI** appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148 71 . **PHI** had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . **PHI** had **PHI** cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA Included a **PHI** blood count of 140,000 , 7 % polys , 1 % bands , 3 % lymphs , 1 % monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76 % **PHI** monocytes , 6 % meta & apos ; s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with **PHI** mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , **PHI** and creatinine 13 1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed **PHI** **PHI** of **PHI** acute bleed , a chest X ray showed **PHI** new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but **PHI** effusions . **PHI** electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high **PHI** Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his **PHI** blood count over the next few **PHI** . **PHI** did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . **PHI** also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .

There is increased tone in his right upper extremity with a slight left pronator drift . On the right side his strength was 5 out 5 . On the left side it is 4 out of 5 in the lower extremities . The patient **PHI** **PHI** intention tremor with the left hand . His reflexes were symmetric with upgoing toes . There was a plantar grasp present on the left hand . Graphesthesia was poor in **PHI** hands . His gait was unsteady and **PHI** was unable to stand on his own . Mental status **PHI** was alert and oriented x3 . RELEVANT LABORATORY DATA **PHI** blood cell count on admission 6.1 , INR on admission 1.0 , relevant imaging . Echocardiogram **PHI** **PHI** showed **PHI** EF of 77 %. **PHI** xray reveals **PHI** consolidation or **PHI** of edema . CT shows a right parietal hyperdense and heterogenously enhancing mass measuring 6.5 x 5 cm with the surrounding vasogenic edema in effacement of the right lateral ventricle . The finding was most consistent with metastatic disease and less likely primary CNS neoplasm such as glioblastoma . MRI showed a **PHI** heterogenous enhancing right parietal mass lesion with a possible ependymal spread . The patient was admitted to the Neurologic **PHI** for workup of his tumor . The neuro oncologist felt that because of the tremendous tumor burden that was likely causing his symptoms the patient will require open debulking as well as obtaining issue for a pathologic diagnosis . **PHI** patient was referred to Dr. **PHI** of the **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Memorial Hospital . On **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** the patient was taken to the operating room for a right parietal occipital craniotomy and debulking of the tumor using stulz neuro navigation . Please see the separately dictated operative report for further details of the procedure . The patient was taken to the recovery room and then to the postoperative floor in stable condition . Of note the patient was seen by cardiology for preoperative assessment . The patient was also seen by physical and occupational therapy during his postoperative course and they recommended that **PHI** go to a rehabilitation facility for his recovery . A postoperative MRI was obtained which revealed **PHI** remarkable findings but only **PHI** surgical changes . Transcranial **PHI** were checked following surgery and the patient was started on Decadron 4 mg **PHI** to prevent swelling . The patient was started on **PHI** for DVT prophylaxis and the patient was also started on Dilantin **PHI** . Of note on **PHIDate** the patient was seen by Urology due to **PHI** inability to void and a 16 French Coude catheter was placed . The patient then was **PHI** voiding trials but eventually **PHI** needed to **PHI** straight cathed prn . At the time of transfer , a 16 Coude catheter was in place and draining well . The patient can have voiding trials at rehab and **PHI** is being maintained on Flomax . The patient had a relatively unremarkable course and his neurologic status continued to improve following the operation . At the time of discharge the patient was alert and oriented x3 and able to swallow pureed and thick diet without a problem . On **PHIDate** repeat imaging revealed some edema and mass affect . The patient was **PHI** **PHI** IV load of Decadron and restarted on IV Decadron which was eventually transferred to po Decadron . The patient was also started on Mannitol . His pathology came back as a **PHI** grade IV glioma .

Chronic leg pain and weakness of uncertain etiology 7 . Chronic obstructive lung disease ( former smoker ) 8 . Chronic anemia ( multifactorial ) 9 . Hyperlipidemia 10 . History of major affective disorder ( currently compensated ) PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE None HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT This is one of several Ponta , **PHI** University Medical Center admissions for this 74 year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench **PHI** proteinuria over one year ago . There were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone . She had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin . The patient **PHI** had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact **PHI** on **PHI** occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency . The weakness is **PHI** focal although since she **PHI** had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking . Her appetite was gone . She was having some nausea . **PHI** recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them . **PHI** changes in her breathing . She did not seem sleepy or confused . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION blood pressure 130 40 , heart rate 78 regular . Weight 132 ,( had been 126 one year previously ). Temperature 97 . The patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities . She could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic . She **PHI** flat affect at baseline and does not give **PHI** clues about somatic distress when she **PHI** some . Her lungs were clear . heart ; without murmur or gallop . Her jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal . soft , **PHI** tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds . **PHI** hepatosplenomegaly or masses . She had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema . She was moving all four extremities . Her cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection . LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION Hematocrit 24.6 , **PHI** count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , **PHI** and creatinine 71 5.2 , glucose 177 . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT The patient was admitted to the Ponta , **PHI** University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K **PHI** with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits . Over the following **PHI** , she was gently hydrated . Her urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 . She was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney . In the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma . She tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had **PHI** impact by the time of her admission . The patient , her son **PHI** So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis . The family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable . They did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty **PHI** PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive **PHI** followed by four **PHI** off , followed by four **PHI** on , etc . for a total of eight sessions of four **PHI** of Decadron on . By the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive **PHI** as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300 & apos ; s or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH . On the **PHI** when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes . There had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her **PHI** although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload . Potassium did not appear to **PHI** a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization . She was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that **PHI** been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak . The problem **PHI** **PHI** a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes + her myeloma . The patient also requested to **PHI** do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So . The patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal . She will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we **PHI** or **PHI** not elect further such treatments . **PHI** ON **PHI** 1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d . 2. clonazepam 0.5 **PHI** PO q.h.s . 3. risperidone 3 **PHI** PO q.h.s . 4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially **PHI** insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subQ , 251 to 300 give six units subQ , from 301 to 350 give eight units subQ , from 351 to 400 give ten units subQ , and if over 400 give twelve units subQ . she also **PHI** standing doses of insulin NPH ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only **PHI** used during the **PHI** of high Decadron and perhaps should not **PHI** used on the **PHI** without Decadron . 5 .

Mr. **PHI** **PHI** a history of cardiac risk factors , including hypertension , hyperlipidemia , obesity . **PHI** had developed intermittent chest pressure with exertion since last fall . **PHI** was placed on cardiac **PHI** after a stress test had revealed reversible defects in the anteroseptal and apical leads . On **PHI** , **PHI** continued to have some discomfort , although this was not quite clear from the outpatient setting . **PHI** attempt at medical management was continued . However , the patient developed crescendo pattern angina pectoris and presented on the day of admission . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY As above . **PHI** ON ADMISSION Lipitor . Lopressor . Aspirin . Imdur . Nitroglycerin prn . ALLERGIES **PHI** known drug allergies . SOCIAL HISTORY The patient lives with is wife . TOBACCO History of heavy smoking in the past . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION **PHI** pressure 112 , **PHI** 96 %, afebrile . Lungs clear . S1 , S2 . **PHI** significant murmurs . Abdomen Obese and soft . Extremities Without edema . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his EKG . **PHI** became **PHI** free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to **PHI** Hospital . However , **PHI** developed recurrent **PHI** discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and **PHI** was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . In the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed **PHI** 7 , RV 36 9 , wedge 16 . **PHI** was treated with **PHI** in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates . **PHI** was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals . The circumflex was codominant with severe 90 % lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50 % lesion in a **PHI** OM . The right coronary artery was codominant and had **PHI** ostial stenosis in the 70 % range . Left ventriculography revealed **PHI** akinetic anterolateral wall . A balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above . The patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending . The procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re flow and two stents needed to **PHI** placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending . The distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber . A good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated . His peak CPK was in the 3000 range . The patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on **PHI** and heparin . **PHI** underwent bronchoscopy , which showed **PHI** specific lesion . In addition , chest CT showed **PHI** obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis . It was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis . In addition , the patient had confusion and delirium . **PHI** CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe . **PHI** was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol . In addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented . The patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on **PHIDate** to receive a stent to the tight circumflex . This was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly . **PHI** tolerated it well . The ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission . The patient was transferred to **PHI** Hospital . **PHI** had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post void residuals up until the time of this dictation . **PHI** was still having 300 cc or so **PHI** void remaining in his bladder . **PHI** is followed by Dr. **PHI** in this regard . At the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy . **PHI** **PHI** had **PHI** recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure . Of note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed **PHI** ejection fraction in the 40 % range with apical akinesis .

The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees . She **PHI** 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation . Pulses are fine . IMAGING X rays were reviewed . They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip . RECOMMENDATIONS Dr. **PHI** **PHI** recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . HOSPITAL COURSE Please refer to the operative note by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** for details of the procedure . Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization . Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations . It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours . However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93 %. Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s . **PHI** the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work up with a chest X ray , which essentially was normal . **PHI** ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2 at 62 . Therefore , **PHI** her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine **PHI** was consulted at that time . They agreed with our plan . On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe . She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was **PHI** doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been **PHI** for DVT prophylaxis . With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain **PHI** INR of 2 to 3 with **PHI** overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three **PHI** . She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three **PHI** while she was heparinized . Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95 %. She was **PHI** perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery . She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain . She was **PHI** posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well . She continued to **PHI** followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy . Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would **PHI** monitored for six months to maintain **PHI** INR of 2.0 to 3.0 . **PHI** ON **PHI** The patient will continue all of her pre admission **PHI** , though **PHI** nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g . , aspirin or ibuprofen , will **PHI** **PHI** while she is on Coumadin therapy . 1 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 33 year old gravida 7 , para 2 , **PHI** 4 , at 30 and **PHIDate** weeks on admission with a known complete previa who presented for her second bleeding per vagina today , on the day of admission . The patient was a **PHI** admit on **PHIDate** , **PHIDate** for first bleeding episode . She was beta complete during that admission and followed in the special OB Clinic since discharge on **PHIDate** . The patient had a bleeding episode on **PHIDate** but told **PHI** one and it resolved spontaneously . On **PHIDate** , the patient had bleeding per vagina with two pads , denied any abdominal pain or contractions . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Noncontributory . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY None . **PHI** Prenatal vitamins . ALLERGIES **PHI** known drug allergies . PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY In 1981 , the patient had a **PHI** in the first trimester . In 1987 , full term normal spontaneous vaginal delivery of 6 pound male . In 1988 , first trimester **PHI** . In 1991 , first trimester **PHI** . In 1990 , one full term normal spontaneous vaginal delivery , 8 pound male . In 1992 , first trimester **PHI** . Current pregnancy . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Afebrile with stable **PHI** **PHI** . Fetal heart rate in the 140 range . Abdomen was soft , **PHI** tender , **PHI** palpable contractions . Vaginal pad showed **PHI** bleeding . LABORATORY DATA Hematocrit of 36.8 . RH status is positive . HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted and followed closely on strict bed rest . Fetal tracing was reassuring . The patient was beta complete on **PHIDate** . Pediatric consult was done during last admission , normal survey , size equal to dates . The patient was observed on the floor . On hospital day two , the patient had another small bleed which resolved spontaneously . There were **PHI** contractions . The baby & apos ; s fetal heart tracing was in the 130 range to 140 range , not formally reactive but with great short term and long term variability . After this episode , there was **PHI** further bleeding and after three additional **PHI** at bed rest , the patient , against our advice , decided to go home . A long discussion including Dr. **PHI** **PHI** and the **PHI** Medical Center discussed with the patient the risks of leaving the hospital **PHI** a complete previa with several known bleeds in the past as well as instability . The patient understood all risks involved including significant maternal hemorrhage and poor fetal well being . In spite of these potentially serious risks to her and the baby she felt she wanted to **PHI** at home . We reminded her that even though she lives 15 minutes away , if she stays in the hospital we can act faster to put in **PHI** iv , give her fluids and blood , and perform a c s if necessary than if she **PHI** to come in from home and those few minutes can make a difference between a good and bad outcome . She accepted these risks and opted to **PHI** discharged home today . She **PHI** offered that she **PHI** plenty of care at home including a housekeeper and will **PHI** able to remain on bed rest and live in **PHI** and knows to immediately come to the hospital for any bleeding . She **PHI** family members who will **PHI** with her at home and will keep the phone number for the ambulance by the phone . Therefore , the plan was for the patient to **PHI** discharged home today on strict bed rest with all precautions **PHI** .
